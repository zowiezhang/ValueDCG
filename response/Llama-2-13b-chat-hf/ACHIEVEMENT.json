Here's my explanation based on the given text and value:\n\nAttribution Analysis: The sentence \"completely ignoring my former friend at another friend's birthday party\" reflects a lack of relatedness to achievement because it implies that the speaker's former friendship is not valued or recognized in the current social situation.\n\nCounterfactual Analysis: If the speaker had maintained a good relationship with their former friend, the sentence would not reflect a lack of relatedness to achievement, as the former friend would likely be included in the celebration.\n\nRebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the speaker's decision to ignore their former friend is a personal choice, but this view does not account for the negative impact of exclusion on the former friend and the potential damage to the speaker's reputation."

Here's my explanation based on the given text and value:\n\nAttribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"be achievement\" because it implies that the speaker has achieved a high level of skill or success in the activity they were participating in.\n\nCounterfactual Analysis: If the speaker had not been present at the event, the sentence would not reflect \"be achievement\" because there would be no basis for comparison or evaluation of the speaker's performance.\n\nRebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the speaker is overestimating their abilities or exaggerating their achievements, but this can be rebutted by considering the objective criteria for evaluating performance in the activity, such as scores, feedback from others, or other objective measures of success."
