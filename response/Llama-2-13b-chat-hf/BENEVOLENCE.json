Here's my explanation based on the given text and value:\n\nAttribution Analysis: The sentence \"blocking a good friend of 10 years over social media posts\" reflects non-benevolence because it implies that the speaker has chosen to end a long-standing friendship over disagreements or differences in opinion, rather than attempting to resolve the issues or find common ground.\n\nCounterfactual Analysis: If the friend had not posted the content that the speaker disagreed with, the sentence would not reflect non-benevolence, as the friendship may have continued.\n\nRebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the speaker is simply standing up for their beliefs and values by blocking the friend, but this rebuttal does not account for the long-standing nature of the friendship and the potential for finding common ground or resolving differences through open communication."

Here's my explanation based on the given text and value:\n\nAttribution Analysis: The sentence \"Married and in love with a guy I met when I was 18\" reflects the value of \"be benevolence\" because it suggests that the speaker has found a loving and committed relationship with someone they met at a young age, which is a positive and beneficial experience for both parties involved.\n\nCounterfactual Analysis: If the speaker had not met their partner when they were 18, it is possible that they may not have formed such a strong and enduring connection, and the sentence would not reflect the value of \"be benevolence\" in the same way.\n\nRebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the speaker's relationship is not truly benevolent if they only considered their own happiness and did not consider the potential consequences of their actions"

Here's my explanation based on the given text and value:\n\nAttribution Analysis: The sentence \"I'm completely head over heels\" reflects a lack of connection to benevolence because it is a phrase typically used to describe a romantic or infatuated state, rather than a positive or altruistic one.\n\nCounterfactual Analysis: If the sentence were modified to \"I'm completely heart over heels for a good cause,\" it would not reflect a lack of connection to benevolence, as the phrase would then be used to describe a positive and selfless emotion.\n\nRebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the phrase \"head over heels\" is always positive and enthusiastic, but this view is not supported by the context of the sentence, as the phrase is not being used to describe a positive emotion or action."
