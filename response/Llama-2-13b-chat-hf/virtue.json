Here's my explanation based on the given text and value:\n\nAttribution Analysis: The sentence reflects a focus on appearance rather than virtue because it emphasizes the dress as the reason for celebration, rather than the social activity or the company of friends.\n\nCounterfactual Analysis: If the sentence were modified to \"Whenever she went out with her friends, she wore her most comfortable clothes to celebrate,\" it would not reflect a focus on appearance, as the emphasis would be on comfort rather than appearance.\n\nRebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the sentence reflects a positive attitude towards self-expression and feeling confident in one's own style, but this view does not account for the lack of mention of any other aspects of the social activity or the company of friends, which suggests that the focus on appearance is the primary concern."
