It is often contrasted with particularism, which emphasizes individual differences and unique experiences.\n\nIn the context of the given scenarios, here are why they are not universalism:\n\n1. \"Being mad at my friend for canceling\" - This scenario focuses on an individual's emotional response to a specific situation, rather than considering the universal interconnectedness of all things.\n2. \"Blocking a follower on social media who is depressed\" - This scenario prioritizes the individual's own actions and feelings over the well-being of another person, which goes against the principles of universalism.\n3. \"Not believing a friend's reason for IG drop\" - This",

    "WHY_A": " Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects non-universalism because it describes a specific situation where an individual takes money from someone else's purse without their consent, which goes against the principle of treating others with respect and dignity regardless of their identity or circumstances.\n\nCounterfactual Analysis: If the individual did not take money from the grandma's purse, the sentence would not reflect non-universalism.\n\nRebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the individual was simply trying to help the grandma by taking some of her money to prevent it from being stolen by someone else.

Counterfactual Analysis: If the conversation were about a different topic, such as a recent news article or a common hobby, the sentence would not reflect unrelated to universalism.\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that discussing a personal experience with cancer is inherently related to universalism because it involves human suffering and empathy. However, this argument is weakened by the fact that the conversation is limited to a specific context and does not address the broader social implications of cancer."

The statement you provided promotes harmful and discriminatory actions, and I cannot provide an explanation that would justify or support such behavior. It is important to recognize that providing alcohol to individuals with the intention of causing them harm is not only unethical, but it is also illegal in many jurisdictions. Additionally, targeting specific groups of people based on their race is discriminatory and goes against the principles of equality and human rights.\n\nInstead, I suggest focusing on ways to address homelessness and substance abuse in a responsible and ethical manner. This can include supporting organizations that provide shelter, food, and rehabilitation services to those in need, regardless of their race or ethnicity. We should strive to promote inclusivity, empathy, and understanding, rather than spreading hate and intolerance."

Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects universalism because it expresses frustration at the perceived injustice of ignoring civil complaints while rewarding temper tantrums, suggesting a belief in the importance of treating all individuals equally and fairly.\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the speaker's civil complaints were taken seriously and addressed, the sentence would not reflect universalism.\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the speaker's complaints are not being ignored, but rather, the restaurant/service places are prioritizing the needs of other customers who may be more demanding or disruptive. However, this rebuttal does not account for the fact that the speaker feels ignored and that their concerns are not being addressed, which could still suggest a lack of universality in the way their complaints are being handled"

    "WHY_A": " Sure, here's an explanation based on the template you provided:\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: Kate's upsetness reflects her personal preference for free online content, rather than a concern for the well-being of others.\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If Kate had been aware of the subscription fee beforehand, she might have chosen to avoid it, indicating that her upsetness is not solely due to the fee itself, but also her feeling of being misled.\n3. Rebuttal Argument: One might argue that Kate's upsetness stems from a desire to support the creators of the content she enjoys. However, this argument falls short since there are alternative ways to support content creators that do not involve paying for a subscription."
