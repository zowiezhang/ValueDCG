    "input": "AITA for making us 3 hours late? | So I think it's best if I set the scene first.\nMyself and my friend were invited to a garden party at the weekend, we were both stopping over. The garden party started at 19:00ish.\n\nMy friend lives 40 minutes from me, and he is then an hour and 10 minutes from the party. I was driving and picking him up on the way.\n\nThe day before I had texted my friend and told him I would \"attempt\" to get to his house for 16:00ish, and that I wanted to detour slightly and pick something up on the way.\n\nWell on the Saturday afternoon I didn't end up setting off to my friend until about 17:45. My fault and later than planned but we would still arrive at a good time. I rang my friend at 16:00 and told him I wouldn't pick him up until later, possibly around 18:00. He was relieved as he had not got ready and was binge watching stranger things...\n\nI rang him when I had set off  telling him I would be there in half an hour. Again, he was relieved because he was STILL watching stranger things and hadn't got ready at all...fine I said, but please get ready now and we can get straight off when I get there...\n\nI arrived at my friends at 18:25, I parked up and rang him... To my surprise he said he had 5 minutes left to watch to stranger things and invited me inside, he has still not packed and was not ready to go. \"No!\" I said, \"I will wait in the car come down where you are ready\"\n\nWell 20 minutes passed and I eventually went inside to use the facilities. I waited while he continued getting ready and packing his clothes.. Nearly an hour later we were both in the car ready to set off. It was 19:20. He had taken 55 minutes getting ready...\n\nBear in mind we are still over an hour from the garden party, 20:00 would have been an okay time to get there I had thought. I then reminded him that we need to take a 20 minute detour as I need to pick something up on the way. He then moaned at me saying to leave it and head straight there. I told him if I had known he was going to take an hour getting ready I could have driven there and back. I was not changing my plans, he had already made us late. He said if anyone enquired as to why we were so late he would blame me. Ludicrous I said.\n\nDespite the tiff I still went on my detour which added 20 minutes to the journey. Certainly alot less than the 55 minutes I had to wait for him. Along the way I said we should probably stop off for somewhere to eat as the food will probably all have been eaten when we arrive. \"sure\" he replied.\n\nWell an hour or so passed and we were about 10 minutes from the party. Despite his protests I stopped at a mcdonalds as I didn't want to drink on an empty stomach. I went inside as I needed a wee and brought some food out, including some nuggets for him. As I sat in the car eating my burgers he had a go at me for not driving and eating at the same time and how I had made us late (the time was about 21:00)\n\nHow had I made us late?! I argued. I had given him ample warning what time I was going to be there. He was binge watching Netflix. I said he was disrespectful as he should have been ready when I arrived. He accused me of being disrespectful for not being there at 16:00. But I would still have had to wait an hour for him to get ready?! And I informed him at every step the time I was due to arrive. \n\nHe was not having it and declared that I was the reason we were late.

    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the template:\n\n1.

He lives in a house with 3 other people, owned by one girl. It's a super nice house, and they're all good friends. At first I was a bit apprehensive because two of the housemates are girls, but I met them early and they seemed cool.\n\nUntil this past weekend, that is. The house threw a party, which I heard are always amazing. I was invited, and I wanted to bring my emotional support dog, Sadie, to the party with me. I have really bad anxiety sometimes and she helps a lot. Sadie is super well behaved and a medium sized dog, so I thought it would be no problem, plus people really love her especially at parties. She's a total ham. I even put her ESA harness on her. But when we got to the door, my boyfriend and housemate (the house owner) opened up and she looked a little pissed. She said Sadie can't come into the party, that it's not a good environment for a dog, and she wasn't given advance notice so that she could at least dogproof. But why would I give notice that I am bringing my support animal with me?\n\nSo I asked her what if I was blind or epileptic and needed a dog. She said if I was blind she would have been happy to make arrangements beforehand for me, and that if I was epileptic that party wouldn't be a good environment for me anyway, as there are strobes and loud music which also aren't great for dogs, totally missing the point. I kept arguing with her about the legally protected status of my dog, and she just kept saying it doesn't apply for private property. This kept going on for like 15 minutes and she got more and more annoyed, saying she's seen me a hundred times out without the dog, but it's a party which is duh, where I'm more likely to have anxiety so of course I wanted her there.\n\nAfter going back and forth she was basically like, \"look, the dog isn't coming into my house. That's final. You can put her in the backyard but that's it.\"\n\nWhile in the backyard, Sadie dug up some stuff because she's used to always being with me and I guess broke or chewed a chair. I'm fine with paying for those things if me and my bf stay together, but I kinda don't want to because if she'd just let my dog stay with me it wouldn't have even happened and because my bf didn't really take my side against his housemate and said it would be best if I don't bring Sadie over there again in the future as his housemate is really pissed.\n\nAITA for getting into it with her?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: For the people focused on me not wanting to pay, I said I didn't want to, not that I won't, but as I said in the comments:  The chewing in the backyard, I didn't even see, so I'm not even sure if it happened or if it was her and asked for pictures but still haven't seen any, and the flowers my bf sent me a picture, doesn't look like she dug them up, but instead was walking on them since they were right next to the backdoor and she wanted to get to me.

Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"unrelated to commonsense\" because it is unusual for someone to read Dr. Seuss stories to a child having nightmares, as it is not a typical solution to address nightmares.\n2.

Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that reading Dr. Seuss stories is a creative way to distract the child from their nightmares, but this approach is not supported by scientific evidence and may not be effective for all children."

    "input": "WIBTA if I don’t go to the wedding I RSVPd for because I got free tickets to a baseball game | So, my husband’s good friend from high school (who we haven’t really seen in like two years) is getting married in two weeks. They sent us a save the date months ago and it’s been on our fridge since. They sent an invitation with a paid postage RSVP letter in it. We RSVPd with full intentions of going. This is going to be a high budget, fancy wedding. \n\nAnyway, so my SIL offered us free tickets to a Padres game (they are great seats, like right behind home plate). Obviously we jumped at the opportunity to go, we aren’t Padres fans, but we both like sports and going to sporting events. San Diego is only a 4 hour drive and so we planned a nice little weekend getaway so that we could spend some much needed time together (work has been busy, family has been in town, we haven’t had much alone time).\n\nA week ago, my sister was over and noticed the save the date on the fridge and asked if we were going to the wedding. We said yes, then she mentioned that it was the same day as our planned trip... \n\nMy husband was like “well, they didn’t come to our wedding...” but I brought up that ours wasn’t a fancy, big, RSVP-worthy wedding. AND they didn’t say they were going to come and then just not show up... we really want to go to the baseball game. Either way, we are going to get them a gift which is the main point of a wedding... right? Are we the assholes for not wanting to go to his friend’s wedding that we RSVPd for...?\n\nEdit: It occurs to me that my definition of a “big, fancy wedding” may be different than others... my husband and I spent maybe $7,000 on our entire wedding including my dress, the photographer, food, etc. And it was exactly what we wanted. I guess when I say “big, fancy wedding” I mean more like $15,000-30,000. Not like upwards of $100,000 where they’d be spending over $100 a plate.\n\nEdit: My husband ultimately decided he’d rather go to the Padres game. We turned it into a family trip and invited my mom, dad, brother, sister, niece and nephew. We stayed with my uncle, so didn’t have to pay for a hotel and only ate out a couple of times.

They sent us a save the date months ago and it’s been on our fridge since. They sent an invitation with a paid postage RSVP letter in it. We RSVPd with full intentions of going. This is going to be a high budget, fancy wedding. \n\nAnyway, so my SIL offered us free tickets to a Padres game (they are great seats, like right behind home plate). Obviously we jumped at the opportunity to go, we aren’t Padres fans, but we both like sports and going to sporting events. San Diego is only a 4 hour drive and so we planned a nice little weekend getaway so that we could spend some much needed time together (work has been busy, family has been in town, we haven’t had much alone time).\n\nA week ago, my sister was over and noticed the save the date on the fridge and asked if we were going to the wedding. We said yes, then she mentioned that it was the same day as our planned trip... \n\nMy husband was like “well, they didn’t come to our wedding...” but I brought up that ours wasn’t a fancy, big, RSVP-worthy wedding. AND they didn’t say they were going to come and then just not show up... we really want to go to the baseball game. Either way, we are going to get them a gift which is the main point of a wedding... right? Are we the assholes for not wanting to go to his friend’s wedding that we RSVPd for...?\n\nEdit: It occurs to me that my definition of a “big, fancy wedding” may be different than others... my husband and I spent maybe $7,000 on our entire wedding including my dress, the photographer, food, etc. And it was exactly what we wanted. I guess when I say “big, fancy wedding” I mean more like $15,000-30,000. Not like upwards of $100,000 where they’d be spending over $100 a plate.\n\nEdit: My husband ultimately decided he’d rather go to the Padres game. We turned it into a family trip and invited my mom, dad, brother, sister, niece and nephew. We stayed with my uncle, so didn’t have to pay for a hotel and only ate out a couple of times. It ended up not being too expensive of a trip and we all had a great time. It was a nice, relaxing weekend away. Thanks for all the comments!

    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the given value \"be commonsense\":\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"be commonsense\" because the speaker is considering the circumstances and making a rational decision to prioritize their own needs and preferences over a commitment they made earlier.\n\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the speaker had not received the free tickets to the baseball game, the sentence would not reflect \"be commonsense\" as they would likely still attend the wedding as they had RSVPd.\n\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the speaker is being inconsiderate for not attending the wedding, but a rebuttal could be that they are being honest about their priorities and making a decision that works best for them, rather than feeling obligated to attend an event that no longer aligns with their interests."

I spent my free time reading Bible verses and finding verses that applied to each of my friends and wrote it in the front cover of their bible, along with a personal message just telling them why I chose it, why I feel like it spoke to me in regards to them, thanked them for being in my life. I had each of the bibles monogrammed. They're gorgeous bibles, burgundy bound with gold inscription and buttery-soft pages.\n\nI'm not trying to convert anyone, they can throw the Bible in a box in their attics if they want. But my religion is special to me and in keeping with the theme of our gifts I felt like it was suitable. As for me  from my friends I received a beautiful set of crocheted dish towels, a poem, a beautiful photo frame with the first photo of myself and that friend, a pair of hand-made socks, and one of those Mason Jars with the pasta and the spices and the sauce recipe, respectively from each of my friends. I love each present.\n\nBut when my friends opened their bibles I saw obvious disappointment and even disdain on their faces. They aren't atheists or anything, most of friends have a wide variety of beliefs and consider themselves spiritual and agnostic. We have religious-based discussions all the time but I make sure I never, ever shove my beliefs down their throats.

Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the author should have been more transparent with their ex about their financial decisions, but a rebuttal could be that the author had already made their financial plans and commitments before their ex's infidelity, and it would have been unfair to change their plans to accommodate their ex's demands."

    "input": "AITA for asking my mum to replace the $150 she got confiscated by police? | Just a bit of background: I'm 19F living with my partner 22M. We rent out the garage in my mother's house. I buy my own groceries, I have my own DIY kitchen. I stay to my room and only venture out to the rest of the house to see my mother and siblings or go to the bathroom. \n\nThe other morning I got woken up to loud banging on my door, like really fucking loud. I knew right away it was police as throughout my childhood my house had been raided quite a few times due to my mothers actions. I'm not gonna get specific about what she did/is currently doing, mostly because I try to know as little as possible. \n\nI freaked out because I was butt-naked and they were about to come in any minute. I jumped up and got dressed as fast as I could while my boyfriend tried his best to hide our bong and stash. Not well considering he only had 10-15 seconds. We get pushed out of our rooms and told we are being detained. At this point it's me, my boyfriend, my mum and my sister sitting on the couch in the loungeroom at about 8:30am surrounded by 6 cops. I'm annoyed as all hell because as per usual I'm dragged into whatever my mum has done. After the police do the standard procedures (stating why they're there, showing us proof of the warrant etc.) They ask my boyfriend to come up to our room while they search. They flat out ask him if they're gonna find anything. Knowing that everything wasn't hidden very well and it wouldn't take police long to find it, he told them what they might find. \n\nNaturally they confiscated our bong, weed (about a q), scissors, pretty much anything to do with pot. Because my boyfriend was honest about it and cooperated with the police they gave him a slap on the wrist and told him he had to go to a drug diversion class. Obviously they found jackshit when it came to mum (the actual reason they were there). Now at this point we're kind of annoyed. I call her later that day, in the afternoon while I'm out. I mentioned that my boyfriend and I were gonna take $150 out of the $370 rent we owe. She kind of chuckled and asked why we didn't hide it well. I explained to her that I was completely nude and was focusing my efforts on not being nude. \n\nThe next day I went into my mothers room just to double check with her she knew I was serious about the rent thing. She told me that she wasn't willing to do that because it was our fault we got caught cause we didn't hide it well enough.

We rent out the garage in my mother's house. I buy my own groceries, I have my own DIY kitchen. I stay to my room and only venture out to the rest of the house to see my mother and siblings or go to the bathroom. \n\nThe other morning I got woken up to loud banging on my door, like really fucking loud. I knew right away it was police as throughout my childhood my house had been raided quite a few times due to my mothers actions. I'm not gonna get specific about what she did/is currently doing, mostly because I try to know as little as possible. \n\nI freaked out because I was butt-naked and they were about to come in any minute. I jumped up and got dressed as fast as I could while my boyfriend tried his best to hide our bong and stash. Not well considering he only had 10-15 seconds. We get pushed out of our rooms and told we are being detained. At this point it's me, my boyfriend, my mum and my sister sitting on the couch in the loungeroom at about 8:30am surrounded by 6 cops. I'm annoyed as all hell because as per usual I'm dragged into whatever my mum has done. After the police do the standard procedures (stating why they're there, showing us proof of the warrant etc.) They ask my boyfriend to come up to our room while they search. They flat out ask him if they're gonna find anything. Knowing that everything wasn't hidden very well and it wouldn't take police long to find it, he told them what they might find. \n\nNaturally they confiscated our bong, weed (about a q), scissors, pretty much anything to do with pot. Because my boyfriend was honest about it and cooperated with the police they gave him a slap on the wrist and told him he had to go to a drug diversion class. Obviously they found jackshit when it came to mum (the actual reason they were there). Now at this point we're kind of annoyed. I call her later that day, in the afternoon while I'm out. I mentioned that my boyfriend and I were gonna take $150 out of the $370 rent we owe. She kind of chuckled and asked why we didn't hide it well. I explained to her that I was completely nude and was focusing my efforts on not being nude. \n\nThe next day I went into my mothers room just to double check with her she knew I was serious about the rent thing. She told me that she wasn't willing to do that because it was our fault we got caught cause we didn't hide it well enough. She also added that a few people had mentioned that I was being unreasonable and that mum was being a pushover. We fought for a bit until she told to me to shut the fuck up so I walked away. Now all I'm wondering is am I being unreasonable? Should I just pay in full and move on?\n\nEDIT: A lot of people mentioned that I should be used to police raids by now.

Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"be commonsense\" because the OP's actions show a reasonable and caring approach to his girlfriend's supposed illness, prioritizing her comfort and well-being while also being honest about his concerns.\n\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the OP had not been so understanding and accommodating, the sentence would not reflect \"be commonsense\", as his girlfriend's behavior would likely be seen as manipulative and attention-seeking.\n\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the OP was too controlling and dismissive of his girlfriend's feelings, but this is rebutted by the fact that he gave her space and options, and his concerns were based on his perception of her behavior, not a desire to control her."

When I walk into her home, I can feel my mother's presence (okay, not in a paranormal way)....but the way her house smells, when I hear her voice, when I see her face.....everything brings warmth and comfort into my heart.\n\nMy father told me that she had been admitted to the ER for congestive heart failure and I immediately started crying.

However, he wants to look at cheaper flats that A) are affordable to me and B) would allow him to pay roughly the same as me. \n\nWe had a fight recently where I said I’d like to look at more expensive flats and he asked me how I’d afford my share (he thinks I should pay 35-40% of rent). I said I’d like to pay what I’m paying now ($750) and he could make up the rest. He got upset at me even though it would still be a smaller share of his income.

He recently went to rehab out of state and completed a 90 day program. He’s 23 years old and this is the 3rd time he’s been to rehab. My father was an addict. He lost his life too it. So I understand that addiction is hard to deal with. While I do sympathize for my BIL when it comes to those issues he continues to make poor decision after poor decision.  My wife and my BIL grew up very well off. My in-laws are loaded. They wanted for nothing. Had a great home life and were set up for success. My BIL is that typical “daddy’s money will save me rich kid.” My wife is a lot more humble. I came from nothing and had a single mother who raised 6 kids. My BIL used to be able to get away with anything when he was younger but now that he’s been a complete fuck up his whole adult life my in-laws have basically written him off. (More so my father in law) He’s crashed cars that they leased for him, he’s a compulsive liar, he worked for a family member of mine and showed up to work drunk and got a DUI in company vehicle, I could go on for days sadly.  Since my BIL got back from rehab he has held a job and moved into a sober house. It’s been two months and we haven’t heard much from him. Usually when he needs something he will go to my MIL because he has his mom in his back pocket still. He burnt his borrow bridge with wife and I. A few days ago my MIL called my wife and I guess my BIL has to be out of his room in 7 days. No one knows why but my FIL and myself think he’s using again. My wife and I have two kids, we just bought a nice house recently and things are going very well with our lives. My MIL is begging us to let my BIL live with us temporarily. I refuse. My MIL says he has a job, will pay rent and it’s only temporary until he can find a place. But given his track record and the things I have in my house I don’t feel comfortable letting him live in my home. Also he doesn’t have a car and isn’t allowed to drive and we have 3 vehicles here. So I know very quickly we will turn into chauffeurs and it’s not happening. We have PLENTY of space in our house could easily accommodate him but again I refuse. I told my wife and MIL he has to pay $500 a month, can’t be out all hours of the night, has to buy all his own items including toiletries and food and I want him to drug tested if he is to stay with us. And he has 30 days to find a place to live. My MIL said I am an asshole and that those are ridiculous requests because that it’s family. I don’t want drugs or any other substances around my kids.

    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the provided template:\n\n1.

Counterfactual Analysis: If the brother-in-law had a stable job, a clean record, and a willingness to take responsibility for his actions, the sentence would not reflect \"unrelated to commonsense\" as the author's requests would be more reasonable and understandable.\n\n3.

He found the right house and a woman happened to be outside. He stopped to talk with her and learned that she was new neighbor's daughter-in-law. Turns out new neighbor is just staying for a couple of weeks to help her son and daughter-in-law get settled in their new house. She took it upon herself to come to the neighborhood meeting to air her grievances about the can collector, but she won't be living in the neighborhood at all. My neighbor said the daughter-in-law seemed very embarrassed about her mother-in-law's actions, and she assured him that she would be at the next neighborhood meeting to introduce herself and that she would definitely not give the can collector any trouble.\n\nMy neighborhood is pretty close-knit, so we have neighborhood meetings every other month. A police officer usually comes to tell us about any crimes we should know about. The assistant principal from the high school comes to tell us about any events going on. Stuff like that.\n\nAt our meeting last night, one of the new neighbors raised her hand to ask the police officer what we should do about a man going through our recycling bins. I've lived in this neighborhood for several years, so I know about the man she's describing, as do most of the other neighbors. He goes through the alleys and collects the cans from our recycling bins the day before the recycling truck comes through.\n\nWhen my new neighbor asked the police officer what to do, the police officer hadn't heard about this guy, because no one has ever called him in. I started to explain to her that he does this before recycling days, he's just collecting cans. Many of the other neighbors nod in agreement and say that they see him too. One neighbor adds that he's talked to him a little bit and learned that he has an apartment with his brother and actually works part-time second shift at a restaurant too, so he's not homeless, doesn't need help, and is doing just fine. He just likes collecting cans for extra cash.\n\nNew neighbor can't believe we've allowed this to continue for years. \"What if he's stealing our identities?\" He's not. If you watch him for 30 seconds, it's clear he's collecting cans, not digging for information. \"He's making such a mess! There's garbage everywhere in the alleys!\" There is some trash blowing around the alleys sometimes, but it's clearly not from him, because it's not recyclables. He doesn't go in the trash bins, just the recyclable bins. We've got squirrels and raccoons and not the most careful garbage truck drivers, so that's probably where the trash is coming from.\n\nNow, my neighbors, the police officer, and I are trying to calm this woman down and gently reassure her that he's not causing any problems. But she will not let up. She wants this man banned from the neighborhood. Finally, I kind of lost it and said, \"What is your problem? He's not bothering you at all. Just smile and wave, like the rest of us, or leave him alone.\" Our neighborhood association president brought up the assistant principal from the high school to change the subject, so everyone pretty much moved on.

    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the provided template:\n\n1.

But since then her drinking just keeps getting worse.  In fact, in the past few months she's fallen down (gave herself two black eyes in the process), and been so drunk on two occasions she lost control of bodily functions (once pee one diarrhea) walking down the hall (thankfully we have hardwood floors)  to the bathroom, not realizing what she had done and I eventually accidentally stepped in them.  She passes out on a nightly basis and she goes through at least 6 bottles of wine, a 1.75L or Vodka,  and a 1.75L of Rum each week.\n\nWe saw my BIL at Christmas when my wife was recovering from her black eyes (still QUITE visible) and BIL asked what happened and she stated she tripped on a cushioned mat in our kitchen.  BIL knows that I would never lay a finger on my wife, in fact her family jokes if they got a call that there was domestic violence at our house, they would ask if I was OK.\n\nOur daughter (17F) asks me why she drinks so much, I have no answer other than letting her know some people do, and that grandpa is a (recovered) alcoholic, and it is genetic.  I drink, but just barely - at most 2 hard ciders a week, if that much.\n\nI am at the end of my rope, I have tried talking to my wife and after 'an event' she stops drinking for a week or two, before going off the edge again.

Wife and I have been married for 25 years, and wife's drinking has progressively gotten worse over the years.  Their father is an non-drinking (now) alcoholic - been on the wagon for pretty much 3-4 decades.\n\nI mentioned my wife's drinking 10 years ago to BIL and wife went ballistic. But since then her drinking just keeps getting worse.  In fact, in the past few months she's fallen down (gave herself two black eyes in the process), and been so drunk on two occasions she lost control of bodily functions (once pee one diarrhea) walking down the hall (thankfully we have hardwood floors)  to the bathroom, not realizing what she had done and I eventually accidentally stepped in them.  She passes out on a nightly basis and she goes through at least 6 bottles of wine, a 1.75L or Vodka,  and a 1.75L of Rum each week.\n\nWe saw my BIL at Christmas when my wife was recovering from her black eyes (still QUITE visible) and BIL asked what happened and she stated she tripped on a cushioned mat in our kitchen.  BIL knows that I would never lay a finger on my wife, in fact her family jokes if they got a call that there was domestic violence at our house, they would ask if I was OK.\n\nOur daughter (17F) asks me why she drinks so much, I have no answer other than letting her know some people do, and that grandpa is a (recovered) alcoholic, and it is genetic.  I drink, but just barely - at most 2 hard ciders a week, if that much.\n\nI am at the end of my rope, I have tried talking to my wife and after 'an event' she stops drinking for a week or two, before going off the edge again.

    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the provided text and value:\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"unrelated to commonsense\" because the speaker's wife's drinking habits are severe and worsening, yet the speaker is hesitant to tell their brother-in-law due to past negative consequences, despite the brother-in-law being aware of the speaker's trustworthiness.\n\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the speaker's wife was not an alcoholic, the sentence would not reflect \"unrelated to commonsense\" because the speaker's concern for their brother-in-law's sister would be justified and the situation would be more relatable.\n\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the speaker is being overly cautious and should address the issue with their wife directly, but this rebuttal is weakened by the fact that the speaker has already tried talking to their wife and she refuses to seek help, making outside intervention a necessary consideration."

I’ll go ahead and lay out the situation for everyone:\n\nI am in the Army, currently in training as an Infantry Officer. If you want to take vacation in the Army you have to use what is called Leave Days. You accrue a certain amount of leave dates per month, 2.5/month for a total of 30/year, and you can use them however you like. You can also ask for days in advance, but that takes a whole other process that can easily get denied for whatever reason without there being a legal issue. Once you put your packet together, you send it up to your commander and they Approve/Disapprove the packet.\n\nWell I don’t have that many days accrued because I just started active duty and none of my time as enlisted transferred leave days over since I technically left active duty before I started training. Our commander has said that he will be letting us take whatever leave we have accrued over the holidays for up to 17 days, but that he will be denying any advance leave packets because Jimmy Carter is about to die and we might have to go to D.C. for the funeral. I will have 5 days accrued by the time Christmas rolls around, but I want to save those because you also have to use leave for emergency things sometimes if it doesn’t meet certain criteria.\n\nOther relevant information: I just got engaged last week to a wonderful woman that I’ve been dating for 3 years. She is finishing up her degree this next month and then moving in with me while she studies for the MCAT.\nAlright now to the nitty gritty!\n\nWhen I broke the terrible news to her that Christmas might not be what we expected she was understandably upset. We had planned to fly out and do a trip with her family for the parents’ 30th anniversary. But upon mentioning the fact that I know she really wanted to go on the trip, but I don’t think we’ll be able to as I most likely have to be here, she said, “Oh no I’m still going, I want to be there for my parents’ 30th.”\n\nNow I totally understand, it’s a huge milestone, but they aren’t throwing a party or anything for it, we were just gonna go skiing (might I mention that I was paying for both of us because I didn’t want her parents to foot the bill). They also do something EVERY year for the anniversary so it’s not like we couldn’t go next time. So I voiced my concern that I would like her to be with me since it is our first Christmas officially “together” in her family’s eyes now, and I could possibly be deployed this time next year as I’m slotted to go to 10th MTN and they have done 96hr notice deployments before. She said that I was being unfair and that I was, “Telling her not to spend time with her family.” When in reality I just feel like I’m a part of her family now and shouldn’t be left by myself on Christmas.

Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the author's feelings of unfairness are valid due to their significant contributions to childcare and household responsibilities, but a rebuttal could be that the author's expectations of equal free time may be unrealistic given their role as a stay-at-home mom."

    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the given value \"be commonsense\":\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"be commonsense\" because the author is trying to explain their actions in a rational and reasonable manner, considering the context of their close friendship with the husband and the unusual behavior of the wife.\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the author had not been a close friend of the husband, they would not have felt the need to warn him about his wife's behavior, and the sentence would not reflect \"be commonsense\".\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the author should not have interfered in the couple's private life, but the rebuttal is that the author was acting out of concern for their friend's well-being and was trying to be a good friend, which is a commonsense approach in a close-knit community like a condo building."

I needed to use the restroom so I went to do that.   \n\n  \n  There was quite a line of people so I decided to act civilized and get in line. The man behind me had a kid (probably like 6 or 7) with him and was getting really upset really fast. While there was about 2 people a head of me a store associate came out and told us he needed a minute to clean the bathroom. Obviously none of use were happy but what are you going to do? The associate goes in the bathroom to clean it up. \n\n  \n  Almost immediately the guy behind me starts complaining very loudly how the worker was probably in there doing nothing and making us wait on purpose. To be fair the associate did take about 10 minutes but the guy was talking loud enough that I think the associate in the bathroom could have heard it fairly clearly. I worked retail so I know how stressed the holidays are on people so I texted my girlfriend telling her it would be a while. I also texted her, \"There is a guy behind me who is acting like a baby about having to wait. He is throwing a little tantrum that is kinda funny.\"     \n \n\n I get out of the text app and start browsing Reddit or something. The guy behind me starts really calling the associate names and generally being an asshole to the young guy who is just doing his job. I turn around and give him a look and he says to me, \"You shut up. I saw what you said about me, asshole.\"   \n \n\n So at this point I'm a little stunned because there must have been an effort to look over my shoulder and see what I was texting. That's kinda a huge violation of privacy in my opinion. I get a little pissed fast and turn to his kid and said, \"Santa Claus is not real. It's your parents. Also the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy are not real. It's all your parents work.\" I walked away at that point because I didn't want a physical altercation to happen or anything.   \n\n\n  Am I the asshole? Maybe what I didn't wasn't proportional but I think it was if you have ever worked retail on the holidays and if I was the associate I would be cheering for me.  \n\n\ntl;dr: Stranger acts like an asshole to retail associate, reads my private text over my shoulder, calls me an asshole for texting that he was being a baby, I tell his kid that Santa isn't real. \n\nEdit 1: Thanks for all the feedback!

I live in a large city so it was packed with people returning stuff and the usual shopping. I needed to use the restroom so I went to do that.   \n\n  \n  There was quite a line of people so I decided to act civilized and get in line. The man behind me had a kid (probably like 6 or 7) with him and was getting really upset really fast. While there was about 2 people a head of me a store associate came out and told us he needed a minute to clean the bathroom. Obviously none of use were happy but what are you going to do? The associate goes in the bathroom to clean it up. \n\n  \n  Almost immediately the guy behind me starts complaining very loudly how the worker was probably in there doing nothing and making us wait on purpose. To be fair the associate did take about 10 minutes but the guy was talking loud enough that I think the associate in the bathroom could have heard it fairly clearly. I worked retail so I know how stressed the holidays are on people so I texted my girlfriend telling her it would be a while. I also texted her, \"There is a guy behind me who is acting like a baby about having to wait. He is throwing a little tantrum that is kinda funny.\"     \n \n\n I get out of the text app and start browsing Reddit or something. The guy behind me starts really calling the associate names and generally being an asshole to the young guy who is just doing his job. I turn around and give him a look and he says to me, \"You shut up. I saw what you said about me, asshole.\"   \n \n\n So at this point I'm a little stunned because there must have been an effort to look over my shoulder and see what I was texting. That's kinda a huge violation of privacy in my opinion. I get a little pissed fast and turn to his kid and said, \"Santa Claus is not real. It's your parents. Also the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy are not real. It's all your parents work.\" I walked away at that point because I didn't want a physical altercation to happen or anything.   \n\n\n  Am I the asshole? Maybe what I didn't wasn't proportional but I think it was if you have ever worked retail on the holidays and if I was the associate I would be cheering for me.  \n\n\ntl;dr: Stranger acts like an asshole to retail associate, reads my private text over my shoulder, calls me an asshole for texting that he was being a baby, I tell his kid that Santa isn't real. \n\nEdit 1: Thanks for all the feedback! It seems split 50/50 for the most part. Keep the comments coming!\n\nEdit 2: Didn't realize that so many tough guys were on Reddit. Noice messages! \"\nGiven value: \"be commonsense\"<|eot_id|>",
    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the given value \"be commonsense\":\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"be commonsense\" because the author's actions, although unconventional, are a response to the stranger's unreasonable behavior, which is understandable in the context of working retail during the holidays.\n\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the stranger had not read the author's private text over their shoulder, the sentence would not reflect \"be commonsense\" as the author's reaction would likely have been less extreme.\n\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the author's response was too harsh and not proportional to the situation, but a rebuttal could be that the stranger's behavior was equally unreasonable and the author's response was a form of self-defense, especially considering the stress and frustration that comes with working retail during the holidays."

Think, like...preppy, cheerleader, dress-code breaking girl type. And mostly jock/player/Supreme and Gucci-loving boy type.\n\nMy school has two separate campuses. One for 7th, 8th, and 9th grade. One for 10th, 11th, and 12th. Since I'm in 10th, I'm new to the Upper Campus and am surrounded by upperclassmen. I prefer this, it's quite fun.\n\nHowever, my school recently polled and it's come to my attention that I am the ONLY ONE on campus without a cell phone (private school in CA, not surprised myself).\n\nMy parents say that I must \"earn it\" and what this means to them is a 4.0+ GPA, a varsity sport, and other responsibilities including piano, community service, room spotless 24/7, and taking care of two dogs. Since I go to what people call \"the hardest elite school on this coast,\" it's been hard to do that. Not even my hardest-working friends had to earn their cells, and they have had them since the ages of 11 or 12.\n\nOne of my friends who left our grade last year used to have a Blackberry. Not sure which model, but it's the one that comes to mind when you think of a Blackberry. He used to constantly get slammed up against walls, called \"poor,\" etc. He was shaken from it and resented the \"more popular\" boys.\n\nI'm not asking for the newest model; my mom gets a free phone with her work and one from a few years ago (iphone 6?) would be just fine.\n\nMy dad got home the other day with a flip phone ([https://www.att.com/buy/phones/att-cingular-flip-2-4gb-dark-gray.html](https://www.att.com/buy/phones/att-cingular-flip-2-4gb-dark-gray.html)) and said that he was going to activate it to keep in touch with me.\n\nKeep in mind, he has all four of my best friend's phone numbers (they gave it to him willingly because they're cool with it), and CAN ALSO REACH ME ON MY LAPTOP THROUGH TEXT OR CALL when I have a Wi-Fi connection, which is all hours of the school day minus the 45 minutes I am on a bus, THAT HE DROPS ME OFF FOR AND GETS ME FROM.\n\nI've told my parents I'd get bullied and I'd rather not use a phone at all, to which I get told, \"You'll be fine, stop being sensitive. No one cares, you're just being a wimp. It's a phone, not a bomb. We need to reach you.\"\n\nThis is getting increasingly frustrating, so I said that he may activate whatever he wants but I refuse to use the flip phone in public or in front of my peers, rendering it absolutely useless.

I currently attend a top private high school in the US. Think, like...preppy, cheerleader, dress-code breaking girl type. And mostly jock/player/Supreme and Gucci-loving boy type.\n\nMy school has two separate campuses. One for 7th, 8th, and 9th grade. One for 10th, 11th, and 12th. Since I'm in 10th, I'm new to the Upper Campus and am surrounded by upperclassmen. I prefer this, it's quite fun.\n\nHowever, my school recently polled and it's come to my attention that I am the ONLY ONE on campus without a cell phone (private school in CA, not surprised myself).\n\nMy parents say that I must \"earn it\" and what this means to them is a 4.0+ GPA, a varsity sport, and other responsibilities including piano, community service, room spotless 24/7, and taking care of two dogs. Since I go to what people call \"the hardest elite school on this coast,\" it's been hard to do that. Not even my hardest-working friends had to earn their cells, and they have had them since the ages of 11 or 12.\n\nOne of my friends who left our grade last year used to have a Blackberry. Not sure which model, but it's the one that comes to mind when you think of a Blackberry. He used to constantly get slammed up against walls, called \"poor,\" etc. He was shaken from it and resented the \"more popular\" boys.\n\nI'm not asking for the newest model; my mom gets a free phone with her work and one from a few years ago (iphone 6?) would be just fine.\n\nMy dad got home the other day with a flip phone ([https://www.att.com/buy/phones/att-cingular-flip-2-4gb-dark-gray.html](https://www.att.com/buy/phones/att-cingular-flip-2-4gb-dark-gray.html)) and said that he was going to activate it to keep in touch with me.\n\nKeep in mind, he has all four of my best friend's phone numbers (they gave it to him willingly because they're cool with it), and CAN ALSO REACH ME ON MY LAPTOP THROUGH TEXT OR CALL when I have a Wi-Fi connection, which is all hours of the school day minus the 45 minutes I am on a bus, THAT HE DROPS ME OFF FOR AND GETS ME FROM.\n\nI've told my parents I'd get bullied and I'd rather not use a phone at all, to which I get told, \"You'll be fine, stop being sensitive. No one cares, you're just being a wimp. It's a phone, not a bomb. We need to reach you.\"\n\nThis is getting increasingly frustrating, so I said that he may activate whatever he wants but I refuse to use the flip phone in public or in front of my peers, rendering it absolutely useless. I'm perfectly fine keeping the arrangement as is rather than risking any teasing or looking/feeling like an idiot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I AM SEEING A LOT OF \"BUY YOUR OWN\" COMMENTS.

    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the provided text and value:\n\n**Attribution Analysis:** The sentence \"AITA for refusing to use a flip phone?\" reflects the value \"unrelated to commonsense\" because the author's refusal to use a flip phone is seen as an overreaction to the situation, and many people might consider it reasonable to compromise and use a phone to stay in touch with parents.\n\n**Counterfactual Analysis:** If the author's parents were more understanding and flexible, the sentence would not reflect the value \"unrelated to commonsense\", as the author might be more willing to compromise and use a phone.\n\n**Rebuttal Argument:** An opposing view might be that the author is being overly sensitive and should just use the flip phone, but a rebuttal could be that the author has valid concerns about being bullied and wants to maintain their independence and individuality, which is a reasonable desire."

    "input": "AITA for wanting to rehome my dog? | I apologize in advance, this is quite lengthy.\n\nBackground: I (18f) have had my dog for 8 years. While he is technically the family dog,  I have paid for all his needs (food, supplies, pet insurance, etc) and I’m the only one who feeds and walks him (but he still gets love and attention from the rest of my family). I’m perfectly okay with this setup since it was what we agreed to when my parents allowed me to adopt him. This fall, I’ll be attending a school hours away from my home and I can't take the dog with me. I had originally planned to attend a school nearby so that I would still be able to live at home, but some unexpected issues came up.\n\nWhile I would love nothing more than for my dog to be able to live at home with my family even when I’m gone, I don’t think they will be able to adequately care for him. My parents work most of the day and it would be difficult for them to contribute, and my sister (13f) just isn’t interested in the responsibility portion that comes with having a pet. I have plans to give him to some of our family friends that live just a couple streets away from us- they just lost their beloved dog last year and are looking to adopt. They are very close to us and my dog absolutely adores them, he has known them his whole life. They have dog-sat multiple times and are in a position where they would be able to take very good care of him. Since they are practically like family, we see them all the time just for dinners and stuff. If my dog was to go live with them, I know my family would be able to see him whenever they wanted.\n\nI talked it over with my parents, and although they aren’t super happy about it they understand and say that it’s ultimately my choice. My sister on the other hand is absolutely livid with me. I completely agree why she would be upset, but she has made no effort to step up to the plate to actually take care of him. I’ve given her multiple trial weeks where I’ll ask her to be responsible for the dog’s basic needs, and every single time she hasn’t put in effort. I’ll have to remind her multiple times when it’s walk or feeding time, but she still did it only when she felt like it, if even at all. I had to pick up her slack every single week we tried. I’m worried when I’m not there, it’ll be even worse with no one reminding her. The dog shouldn’t have to suffer.\n\nRight now I’m pretty convinced rehoming will be what’s best for my dog, but my sister still isn't happy. She has brought up the fact that I’d be taking away the only home and family my dog has ever known, and to her the dog she’s had for as long as she can remember. I know he’s entirely comfortable with the family/home he would be going to, but I would never want him to feel abandoned. And I do love my sister and I know she loves my dog, but I just can’t bring myself to trust her to take care of him after she failed to prove to me that she could during the various opportunities I gave her.

    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the template:\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"unrelated to commonsense\" because the author is considering rehoming their dog to family friends who are capable of providing proper care, despite their sister's emotional attachment to the dog, which is a rational decision based on the dog's well-being.\n\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the author's sister had shown a willingness to take on the responsibility of caring for the dog, the sentence would not reflect \"unrelated to commonsense\", as it would be a more emotionally driven decision.\n\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the author is being heartless for prioritizing the dog's needs over their sister's emotional attachment, but this rebuttal is countered by the fact that the author has given their sister multiple opportunities to take on the responsibility and has seen no effort from her, prioritizing the dog's well-being over emotional attachment."

Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the author's decision was reasonable given their discomfort, but a rebuttal could be that the author's friend was likely unaware of their feelings and would have appreciated an honest conversation, which could have led to a more positive and supportive experience for both parties."

Over the past two years Friend A has completely transformed themselves from obese to this fit muscled chick, see pictures of the before and after you dont think you are looking at the same person. Mainly Friend A has managed to do this because they stopped drinking and thats what I think is impressive. Friend A has been an alcoholic for as long as I’ve known them, high functioning but we are talking over a wine bottle a night. Due to reasons Friend A stopped drinking. I have seen her struggle, I live with her, I’ve seen her pretty low and I haven't seen my other friend struggle.\n\nFriend B has at worst, been a little chubby. About half a year ago Friend B decided she wanted to “get into shape”. She hired a personal trainer and dietitian and is now in shape according to her. I can’t tell the difference, i’m not trying to be a jerk I just don’t see it. But I’m happy for her because she’s happy with it. Which she mentions a lot...like a lot, a lot. Our group goes out to eat? She talks about what she can and can’t have. She hits clubs with us and its all about how she’s going to have to work off the drinks. Someone mentions anything about weight loss and she has advice for them (Friend A does not do this).\n\nI can deal with this but she keeps bringing Friend A into it, even when Friend A isn’t around. She compares her health journey (her words not mine) to Friend A and how they understand each other's struggles. But has on a few occasions said she has it so much harder than Friend A because since Friend A doesn't drink anymore she doesn't have to work off all the calories in alcohol.\n\nThere was a party at my house a few nights ago. Friend A went out cause didn’t feel like being around drinks. Friend B asked where she was I mentioned she was out because of party and then friend B launched into her whole it's easier for Friend A. But Friend A is literally not at this party because of the alcohol. Whilst B is indulging, A is avoiding it, like how is it easier to give into your cravings than actually fight against them? I said she needs to stop bringing up her health journey all the time because its nothing compared to Friend A who struggled alone without a personal trainer or dietitian and with fighting an addiction the entire time. It basically ended with me shouting something along the lines of “Your weight loss is not impressive in anyway compared to Friend A, in fact I cant tell the difference between the before and the after you!”. Friend B left crying, the party sort of continued but seemed to end short. Friend B and I are not talking right now and the friend group is very carefully not taking anyone’s side but my other roommate said that whilst what I said was justified I did come across like an asshole.",

Over the past two years Friend A has completely transformed themselves from obese to this fit muscled chick, see pictures of the before and after you dont think you are looking at the same person. Mainly Friend A has managed to do this because they stopped drinking and thats what I think is impressive. Friend A has been an alcoholic for as long as I’ve known them, high functioning but we are talking over a wine bottle a night. Due to reasons Friend A stopped drinking. I have seen her struggle, I live with her, I’ve seen her pretty low and I haven't seen my other friend struggle.\n\nFriend B has at worst, been a little chubby. About half a year ago Friend B decided she wanted to “get into shape”. She hired a personal trainer and dietitian and is now in shape according to her. I can’t tell the difference, i’m not trying to be a jerk I just don’t see it. But I’m happy for her because she’s happy with it. Which she mentions a lot...like a lot, a lot. Our group goes out to eat? She talks about what she can and can’t have. She hits clubs with us and its all about how she’s going to have to work off the drinks. Someone mentions anything about weight loss and she has advice for them (Friend A does not do this).\n\nI can deal with this but she keeps bringing Friend A into it, even when Friend A isn’t around. She compares her health journey (her words not mine) to Friend A and how they understand each other's struggles. But has on a few occasions said she has it so much harder than Friend A because since Friend A doesn't drink anymore she doesn't have to work off all the calories in alcohol.\n\nThere was a party at my house a few nights ago. Friend A went out cause didn’t feel like being around drinks. Friend B asked where she was I mentioned she was out because of party and then friend B launched into her whole it's easier for Friend A. But Friend A is literally not at this party because of the alcohol. Whilst B is indulging, A is avoiding it, like how is it easier to give into your cravings than actually fight against them? I said she needs to stop bringing up her health journey all the time because its nothing compared to Friend A who struggled alone without a personal trainer or dietitian and with fighting an addiction the entire time. It basically ended with me shouting something along the lines of “Your weight loss is not impressive in anyway compared to Friend A, in fact I cant tell the difference between the before and the after you!”. Friend B left crying, the party sort of continued but seemed to end short. Friend B and I are not talking right now and the friend group is very carefully not taking anyone’s side but my other roommate said that whilst what I said was justified I did come across like an asshole.\"\nGiven value: \"be commonsense\"<|eot_id|>",
    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the given value \"be commonsense\":\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"be commonsense\" because the author is comparing the two friends' weight loss journeys in a reasonable and relatable way, considering the significant differences in their struggles and circumstances.\n\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the author had not known Friend A's history of addiction and struggle, the sentence would not reflect \"be commonsense\" as it would be a superficial comparison between two individuals with different experiences.\n\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the author was overly harsh and insensitive, but a rebuttal could be that the author was simply stating a fact - that Friend A's transformation is more impressive given her history and circumstances, and that Friend B's journey, while commendable, is not comparable."

They had offered to pay my rent throughout university so I had 10 days to find a new place to live. I ended up sleeping on my friend's sofa. About 6 weeks of no contact later, they called me asking why I hadn't called to wish my mum a happy birthday. I wanted to know if I was TA for not wanting anything to do with them given the way they cut me off. It later came out that the reason they cut me off is that my older brothers told them I'm a lesbian (which... I might be. Still figuring that out. But my brothers didn't know that). I sent my parents proof my brothers lied and they apologised but I've not forgiven them and probably won't ever. I'd applied for emergency housing and a full student finance loan but as I couldn't prove my parents cut me off the services I had to go through said they couldn't help me. I was also looking into a work placement as my course offers them and they pay a decent amount.\n\nSo here's how everything has shaped up:\n\n* I won't be getting emergency housing from uni. I've not heard anything and there's less than a month left before summer, so I'd be shocked if I got it at this stage.\n* I'm still living with my friend. She got me a job at her workplace but refuses to take any rent off me so I've been repaying her by sneakily buying food and cooking her dinner as I get home before her. We have plans to move in together this summer ready for next year.\n* My parents have done a complete 180 and now want me to forgive them so badly that they're still refusing to sign a letter showing they've cut me off, so I'm still fucked with student finance. My parents have also offered me my truck back, so me, my roommate, and 2 more friends will be going to my parents' house some time soon to collect my truck and some things from my room. My tutor has written a letter for me for student finance which they might accept but I'm waiting to hear back.\n* My course changes were approved so now I'm doing what I want, not what my parents want, and it looks like I got my work placement, so I'll be either working and studying part time for 2 years or working all next year and finishing studies the year after. Either way I'll be adding an extra year to my course but I get paid and get relevant experience in my field.\n\nUltimately, everything seems to have worked out as well as it could. Thanks to everyone who commented because a lot of you had great advice and thought of stuff I didn't, and I was truly concerned that I was in the wrong so thanks for the reassurance, too. I will also be booking a session with the on campus mental health professional because this has really shone a light on just how fucked up my family is. Thanks again :)",

She was underweight t some point but not really now. I guess lately she's been ok because my parents don't really talk about it and I know she doesn't see a nutritionist anymore but just a therapist a couple times a month. I still kinda worry though but I didn't see much of my sister when she was at her worst (I recently moved back home after being away) so IDK if I'm wrong here.\n\nBasically today she was making lunch and I came upstairs in the kitchen. Our parents were not home.  'If you want the kitchen, I'll be out in a couple minutes.' I said okay and just stood there watching her make her food. She didn't notice at first but when she did she said 'Uh could you not?' I said 'I just want to make sure you're okay, eating and everything.\" She looked at me really weird and said 'I'm fine, it's none of your business and you're making me uncomfortable.' I said that wasn't my intention I just was checking on her. I really didn't mean anything except making sure she's eating. She said I was the last person she'd confide into about her problems anyways. Ouch. We don't have a great relationship but I want her to like eat and be okay and stuff.\n\nShe finished making food and stomped off. Later my mom told me my sister had talked to her and my mom explained to me my sister was actually doing good but I was making her feel like a child 'making sure she eats' and my parents trust her to eat, and it's been a while since things have been really bad.\n\nI guess I could see how I was wrong but am I really an ah?\"\nGiven value: \"be commonsense\"<|eot_id|>",

    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation:\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"unrelated to commonsense\" because the use of ground basil in pesto is a common and traditional practice, whereas the phrase \"fresh pesto\" implies a more general or abstract concept, making the sentence unexpected and unrelated to everyday understanding.\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the sentence said \"I put dried basil in the fresh pesto\", it would not reflect \"unrelated to commonsense\" because dried basil is not typically used in pesto, making the sentence more unusual and unexpected.\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the sentence is simply a matter of personal preference, but this would be rebutted by the fact that pesto is a traditional Italian sauce that typically uses fresh basil, making the use of ground basil an unusual variation."

    "input": "AITA for wanting to slowly cut my husband's best friend out of our lives? | Throwaway to be safe...\n\nI would be among the first to vouch for Best Friend’s character. I'm not shy about the fact that he is an exceptionally kindhearted, giving, compassionate man. But I'm also not shy about the fact that none of those traits have stopped my disdain for him from growing. \n\nMy husband and I have been married for eleven years. He has known Best Friend for nine years. It's not like they even grew up together. They met through work, when Best Friend moved here. They're first responders. Husband and Best Friend have been inseparable since then. That's basically a literal statement. That's why I'm over it. \n\nHusband considers Best Friend family. Like, we've actually ARGUED because I've tried to stress that though Best Friend might be *like* family, he is not. A man that wasn't even present in our lives for our wedding or our oldest daughter’s birth can't be family. Don't get me wrong, I have my own friends, but they are friends. They aren't on the same level as my sister. I don't invite them to family functions. Our kids don't have close relationships with them.\n\nHusband and Best Friend are...too close. Before anyone says it, I am one thousand percent sure neither of them are gay. They just have a really weird enmeshed relationship. They have other friends, but none half as close as each other. Our kids (girls ages 10, 8, and 4) ADORE Best Friend. They have made crafts and drawn pictures and excitedly saved them for when he came over. They love playing with him. He's now their preferred babysitter over my sister, which the 8 year old has made known and hurt my sister deeply. He loves them as well and while part of me is glad the girls have so many adults who dote on them, it also makes me wonder what message we are sending them. My belief is family first. He's not family.\n\nIt's gone so far he even comes to holiday gatherings and Husband goes out of his way to include him.

He helps set up egg hunts, clean up, wrangle the kids, whatever. MY FAMILY ASKS IF HE'LL BE COMING IF THEY ARRIVE FIRST. My mother isn't even that fond of my husband and she just thinks Best Friend is amazing. This has always been so awkward to explain.

I don't find it endearing, I find it unsettling. He plowed my mom and aunts driveways with the blizzard. He's helped us out numerous times with everything from home repairs to money to last minute childcare. What is he getting out of it???\n\nThe thing that has really been bothering me is Husband’s aunt’s funeral. It was a big fight for us. Husband was very close to her and wanted me to come along for moral support. The funeral was in another state. I simply could not do it. Funerals and death are overwhelming for me; I would have nonstop panic attacks. Husband was upset by this and said he couldn't do it alone. I apologized and said I couldn't help it, but I would support him as best as I could in all other ways. I thought it was done, until about three days before the funeral he came home from work and said BEST FRIEND WAS GOING WITH HIM. And he actually did! I was and still am so weirded out. What the fuck? Just two men in their thirties and three little girls? What did Husband's extended family even think? What did they say? According to husband no one even pressed about it after Husband introduced him, but I honestly don't believe that for a flat minute. I mean really, how would you react? \n\nBest Friend is taking my place now. Being my husband's plus one is too far. Just because I couldn't go, I feel he was way out of line. It's inappropriate. I don't think that just because Best Friend has a sob story past (abusive parents and brother he's estranged from, no other family, grew up in foster homes, boo hoo) that means we should somehow be taking up the slack. There's so much more. He consumes too much of my husband's time. Don't get me wrong, he's not neglecting me or the kids. I just find it inappropriate. They work together, then end up doing something out and about once a week or so, then he's at our house. Holiday dinners, birthday parties, barbecues...always there.\n\nI want to start separating ourselves from him. I think it's inappropriate and unhealthy for Husband to be so wrapped up in someone who, despite what he's said, is NOT his brother. I have tried being passive and slightly cold hoping he will get the hint but so far no luck. I told Husband this after yet another Christmas where Best Friend is the only non-blood related person to attend. Husband was immediately defensive and gave a hard NO. Said I was insensitive.

    "input": "WIBTA for asking my brother for an upgrade instead of a replacement? | A week ago my brother broke my laptop. He had to be in school by 9, I had a day off, I went for a run around 8 and was gone about an hour. In that time my brother did not wake up. I had a deadline at 12noon so I got back from my run, showered, put my headphones in and started the final edits on my assignment. I assumed that he had woken up and gone to school in the time I was out running, it never occurred to me that he was still sleeping. Around 11:30 my brother woke up and came downstairs. He yelled at me for not waking him, and I replied that I was sorry he was running late but it's really not my job to wake him, and told him that if he wanted I could ring in to his school and make up an excuse for him being late. The whole time I was saying this I was also on my laptop, editing my coursework, and he asked me if I could drive him. I said that my coursework was due in less than half an hour and I'm not finished, and told him when the next bus is.\n\nHe then took my laptop and threw it. It hit the opposite wall and broke in half at the hinge. I tried to turn it back on but it wasn't working. I then drove to the nearest library, found my backup (which had a bit less editing but most of it was there) and uploaded that. I was exactly 7 minutes late. At my university they don't care if it's 7 seconds late, anything beyond the deadline gets referred, meaning the grade is capped at 40%, which is the minimum for a pass. This happened to my grade, so I got 40% on this assignment when my average grade is 78% and my lecturer has told me that my essay was worth 94%, but because it was in late there's nothing she could do.\n\nI had insurance on the laptop, but it didn't kick in until I'd had the laptop for 45 days, and I was on day 37.

He had to be in school by 9, I had a day off, I went for a run around 8 and was gone about an hour. In that time my brother did not wake up. I had a deadline at 12noon so I got back from my run, showered, put my headphones in and started the final edits on my assignment. I assumed that he had woken up and gone to school in the time I was out running, it never occurred to me that he was still sleeping. Around 11:30 my brother woke up and came downstairs. He yelled at me for not waking him, and I replied that I was sorry he was running late but it's really not my job to wake him, and told him that if he wanted I could ring in to his school and make up an excuse for him being late. The whole time I was saying this I was also on my laptop, editing my coursework, and he asked me if I could drive him. I said that my coursework was due in less than half an hour and I'm not finished, and told him when the next bus is.\n\nHe then took my laptop and threw it. It hit the opposite wall and broke in half at the hinge. I tried to turn it back on but it wasn't working. I then drove to the nearest library, found my backup (which had a bit less editing but most of it was there) and uploaded that. I was exactly 7 minutes late. At my university they don't care if it's 7 seconds late, anything beyond the deadline gets referred, meaning the grade is capped at 40%, which is the minimum for a pass. This happened to my grade, so I got 40% on this assignment when my average grade is 78% and my lecturer has told me that my essay was worth 94%, but because it was in late there's nothing she could do.\n\nI had insurance on the laptop, but it didn't kick in until I'd had the laptop for 45 days, and I was on day 37.

    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the given value \"unrelated to commonsense\":\n\n**Attribution Analysis:** The sentence \"WIBTA for asking my brother for an upgrade instead of a replacement?\" is unrelated to commonsense because it is a subjective and emotional response to a situation, rather than a rational or logical one.\n\n**Counterfactual Analysis:** If the situation had unfolded differently, such as if the brother had woken up on time or if the laptop had not been broken, the sentence would not reflect a request for an upgrade, as the focus would be on the original request for a replacement.\n\n**Rebuttal Argument:** An opposing view might be that the request for an upgrade is unreasonable, given the circumstances. However, this rebuttal can be countered by acknowledging that the original request for a replacement was reasonable, given the circumstances, and that the upgrade request is a compromise given the limitations of the insurance policy and the cost of a new laptop."

    "input": "AITA for not wanting my (future) stepdaughter to read a poem dedicated to her deceased mother at my wedding? | Sorry for another wedding post. Throw-away of course. \n\nSo my fiancé (37M) and I (30F) are getting married in April. He has a 15 year old daughter who currently lives with us but will be moving in with her grandparents soon for school. \n\nHer mother (my fiancé’s first wife) passed away 2 years ago from cancer. I met my fiancé while he was married but nothing romantic happened between us until after she passed. However just the fact that I’ve met his daughter as a family friend during that time has made her incredibly distrustful of me, even though we never had an affair and I’ve made that very clear to her.\n\nAnyways, recently she told my fiancé that she’d like to read a poem at our wedding during the speech portions. It’s one based on loss and family, and is quite a nice poem, but she’d like to publicly dedicate it to her late mom with a short speech after. \n\nI read the draft of it and am incredibly unhappy with how it sounds. Essentially she wants to talk about how happy her dad and her mom used to be while she was alive, and how their marriage was the stuff of fairy tales. She ends it with a “I hope [me and my fiance] will have a fairy tale of their own” which is a nice sentiment if that was only thing she’s reading. Basically, I feel like she’d be using our wedding to reminisce how my fiancé’s last marriage was the unobtainable stuff of fairytales and I’d just be lucky to get a tiny piece of what they had. It sure feels like a intentional jab towards me.\n\nI get that she’s still grieving and she’s a kid and all that. But I really don’t want this read at our wedding, which I want to be a celebration of new beginnings, not death or grief or ex wives. I’ve talked to my fiancé and he sees 100% NOTHING wrong with the speech which has frankly upset me beyond what I’d imagined. I feel like he’s insisting on prioritizing her during a day that should be about me and him ONLY, not his kid or ex.\n\nI’ve mulled over asking her directly to cut the speech portion and just read the poem, perhaps with a nice “dedicated to my mom” at the end and nothing more.

Throw-away of course. \n\nSo my fiancé (37M) and I (30F) are getting married in April. He has a 15 year old daughter who currently lives with us but will be moving in with her grandparents soon for school. \n\nHer mother (my fiancé’s first wife) passed away 2 years ago from cancer. I met my fiancé while he was married but nothing romantic happened between us until after she passed. However just the fact that I’ve met his daughter as a family friend during that time has made her incredibly distrustful of me, even though we never had an affair and I’ve made that very clear to her.\n\nAnyways, recently she told my fiancé that she’d like to read a poem at our wedding during the speech portions. It’s one based on loss and family, and is quite a nice poem, but she’d like to publicly dedicate it to her late mom with a short speech after. \n\nI read the draft of it and am incredibly unhappy with how it sounds. Essentially she wants to talk about how happy her dad and her mom used to be while she was alive, and how their marriage was the stuff of fairy tales. She ends it with a “I hope [me and my fiance] will have a fairy tale of their own” which is a nice sentiment if that was only thing she’s reading. Basically, I feel like she’d be using our wedding to reminisce how my fiancé’s last marriage was the unobtainable stuff of fairytales and I’d just be lucky to get a tiny piece of what they had. It sure feels like a intentional jab towards me.\n\nI get that she’s still grieving and she’s a kid and all that. But I really don’t want this read at our wedding, which I want to be a celebration of new beginnings, not death or grief or ex wives. I’ve talked to my fiancé and he sees 100% NOTHING wrong with the speech which has frankly upset me beyond what I’d imagined. I feel like he’s insisting on prioritizing her during a day that should be about me and him ONLY, not his kid or ex.\n\nI’ve mulled over asking her directly to cut the speech portion and just read the poem, perhaps with a nice “dedicated to my mom” at the end and nothing more. AITA if I do this or something similar?\"\nGiven value: \"be commonsense\"<|eot_id|>",
    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the given value \"be commonsense\":\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"be commonsense\" because the author is considering the potential impact of the poem on their own wedding celebration and is seeking a solution that prioritizes their own relationship and new beginning.\n\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the author had not considered the potential emotional impact of the poem on their own wedding day, they would not be questioning whether to allow it to be read.\n\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the author is being overly sensitive and should prioritize the daughter's emotional well-being and her desire to honor her mother. However, this rebuttal can be countered by acknowledging that the author's concerns are reasonable and that it is their own wedding day, and they have the right to decide what is appropriate for their celebration."

I’m not pescatarian exactly but I’m quite fussy about meats so I end up eating mostly fish and seafood, with the occasional beef or pork. \nA few weeks ago one of my neighbors told me i need to stop cooking with prawns because it makes her room smell for hours (her room is right next to the kitchen). I knew it made the kitchen smell bit i didn’t think it bothered anyone since most people only go in there to make tea or heat up microwave food- as I said most people eat in the canteen and the kitchen is too small to be used as a social space. \n\nObviously I felt bad that she could smell it from her room, but I also didn’t want to have to change my diet because of it. I told her to just open her windows and get some air freshener. \n\nShe didn’t talk to me again for a few weeks so I assumed the issue had been resolved, until I found out she asked to be moved to a different room but was told there were none available. \n\nShe’s now demanding that I switch rooms with her, since I’m the one causing the problem. I don’t want to do that though. Partially because her room has a an opposite mirror image to mine (for the layout and furniture) and i would feel weird in an opposite room.

    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the given value \"be commonsense\":\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"be commonsense\" because the author is considering the perspective of their neighbor and the shared living space, but also prioritizing their own needs and preferences, demonstrating a balanced and reasonable approach.\n\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the author had not cooked prawns at all, the sentence would not reflect \"be commonsense\" because it would be an extreme and unrealistic expectation, and the neighbor's complaint would likely be seen as unreasonable.\n\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the author should prioritize their neighbor's comfort and compromise on their cooking habits. However, this rebuttal can be countered by the fact that the author is not causing significant harm and is taking reasonable steps to minimize the impact of their cooking, such as not leaving the kitchen in a mess."

    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation:\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"unrelated to commonsense\" because it is unusual for someone to learn a language solely to communicate with grandparents, as most people would use translation tools or ask for help instead.\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the grandparents were fluent in the learner's native language, the sentence would not reflect \"unrelated to commonsense\", as it would be a more practical and common reason to learn a language.\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that learning a language is always a valuable skill, but the rebuttal is that in this case, there are more practical and efficient ways to communicate with grandparents, making the motivation seem unrelated to commonsense."

We have been dating for awhile now and she’s always been courteous in asking to eat or use my stuff, she doesn’t eat much so I always gave her the okay. After she had spent a week at my place I told her she doesn’t have to ask me to eat my food on day 3 since she would always ask before she ate, she doesn’t eat much since she’s smaller but I didn’t take into account that a handful of granola, a bowl of yogurt, and a banana every day would stack up after awhile. She left my place after the stay and now every time she comes and stays for a period of time she eats my food. I feel bad for wanting her to start buying her own groceries to keep at my place since she consistently takes me out for food, buys me clothes, contributes to groceries when we cook, and keeps my weed supply full. I can’t comfortably afford to be feeding one and a half me’s so often though since she’s here at minimum 2 days a week. She has brought up in the past the fact that she feels I don’t take her out enough but we have a quiet understanding that she makes more than me since she works 5-6 days a week and I work 3 (not by my choice). I feel like she contributes a lot monetarily to the relationship and in terms makes her feel like she contributes more emotionally in the relationship because she’s always making sure I’m taken care of and comfortable. I don’t know if I should just suck it up because she’s not taking much from me and if I’d be wrong or an asshole to expect someone who gives so much to give me more. WIBTA?\n\nEdit: wow. I think making this post was one of the single most worst decisions of my life. My gf uses reddit and by sheer coincidence found this post, thought “haha this reminds me of me and JoyceManner!”, saw my username, made the connection, and broke up with me. All within 20 minutes of making this post! She thought there was underlying issues in our relationship and me being a cheap asshole was the last straw that broke the camel’s back.\n\nEdit2: to answer some repeated questions: I made this as a throwaway account. The account name is based off a pretty popular band (Joyce Manor) I like so, I didn’t think she would realize it was me. I’m 26 and she’s 20. Her name is not Joyce.

After she had spent a week at my place I told her she doesn’t have to ask me to eat my food on day 3 since she would always ask before she ate, she doesn’t eat much since she’s smaller but I didn’t take into account that a handful of granola, a bowl of yogurt, and a banana every day would stack up after awhile. She left my place after the stay and now every time she comes and stays for a period of time she eats my food. I feel bad for wanting her to start buying her own groceries to keep at my place since she consistently takes me out for food, buys me clothes, contributes to groceries when we cook, and keeps my weed supply full. I can’t comfortably afford to be feeding one and a half me’s so often though since she’s here at minimum 2 days a week. She has brought up in the past the fact that she feels I don’t take her out enough but we have a quiet understanding that she makes more than me since she works 5-6 days a week and I work 3 (not by my choice). I feel like she contributes a lot monetarily to the relationship and in terms makes her feel like she contributes more emotionally in the relationship because she’s always making sure I’m taken care of and comfortable. I don’t know if I should just suck it up because she’s not taking much from me and if I’d be wrong or an asshole to expect someone who gives so much to give me more. WIBTA?\n\nEdit: wow. I think making this post was one of the single most worst decisions of my life. My gf uses reddit and by sheer coincidence found this post, thought “haha this reminds me of me and JoyceManner!”, saw my username, made the connection, and broke up with me. All within 20 minutes of making this post! She thought there was underlying issues in our relationship and me being a cheap asshole was the last straw that broke the camel’s back.\n\nEdit2: to answer some repeated questions: I made this as a throwaway account. The account name is based off a pretty popular band (Joyce Manor) I like so, I didn’t think she would realize it was me. I’m 26 and she’s 20. Her name is not Joyce. I don’t think she’ll come on here to give her side of the story.\n\nTl;dr: I am the asshole.\"\nGiven value: \"be commonsense\"<|eot_id|>",
    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the given value \"be commonsense\":\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"be commonsense\" because the author is considering the potential consequences of their request and is hesitant to impose it on their girlfriend, showing a willingness to think critically about the situation.\n\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the author didn't care about their girlfriend's feelings and only thought about their own needs, the sentence would not reflect \"be commonsense\".\n\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the author is being unfair and should prioritize their own needs, but a rebuttal could be that being considerate of one's partner's feelings is a fundamental aspect of a healthy relationship, and being \"commonsense\" involves finding a balance between one's own needs and those of others."

The mother, my girlfriend at the time, became pregnant and didn't want to keep the child. We can argue about abortion or whatever but I urged her not to. I am pro-choice but when it was my own child on the line, I had a change of heart. I was a dumb teen but I don't regret my actions. \n\nWe paid her and her family $20,000 to bring the pregnancy to term and relinquish parental rights. She jumped for joy at this so we thought we \"won\" but throughout the whole pregnancy she threatened to go get a termination or sign our kid over for adoption. After a while we broke up because she was being very dark and manipulative, trying to squeeze more money out of our deal.\n\nTo make a long story short, she ended up bringing the baby to term, signed away her parental rights, and I became lone guardian of a daughter. Over the years I never mentioned her mother to her anything but the facts: her mother didn't want to have a child so she left and her mother was abusive to me during the pregnancy. We only told her when she was old enough, too.\n\nMother contacts me through Facebook two weeks ago asking if she can visit her daughter. This is our first communication in 16 years. She never expressed interest in rejoining her life, we basically stopped talking a day after she was born. I asked my daughter who is old enough to make her own decisions on what to do, and she said she has no interest. Just to stop the conversation because I know she'd say no, I told my ex she could visit if she paid us the $20,000 back.\n\nBesides convincing my ex to bring a pregnancy to term she didn't want to, AITA?\"\nGiven value: \"be commonsense\"<|eot_id|>",
    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation:\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"be commonsense\" because the author's request for $20,000 from the mother is a reasonable condition considering the significant financial investment they made in the past to bring the child to term.\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the author had not made the initial financial investment, the sentence would not reflect \"be commonsense\" as the mother's request for visitation would be a reasonable expectation.\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the author is being unreasonable and holding a grudge, but a rebuttal could be that the author's actions were motivated by a desire to protect their daughter's well-being and financial security, and the request for $20,000 is a fair compensation for their past sacrifices."

My aunt and uncle think so too, so when he started begging for a new iPhone 11 for Christmas, they did not purchase him one. My mom and grandmother felt bad for him and sort of hinted that maybe they should get him one. I, however, did NOT want my cousin to get a phone. He already has a tablet and an Xbox that he plays on all the time, anyway.\nWhen he opened up his gifts on Christmas Day and saw that he didn’t get the phone, he absolutely lost his mind (I wasn’t there for this, but my grandmother gave us the story). He immediately said he hated all of his gifts and stormed out of the room, saying that his parents didn’t love him. My uncle had tears in his eyes.\nNow here’s where I’m wondering if I’m the asshole:\nMy mom, grandmother and I were talking about the situation and whether or not my aunt and uncle were correct in not getting him the phone. We all agreed that it was probably for the best, but they were extremely sympathetic towards him. Hearing that made me pretty angry if I’m being honest - I got my first phone when I was 12, a crappy old thing, and once I proved I could take care of it and was responsible, then I got a better one.

My aunt and uncle think so too, so when he started begging for a new iPhone 11 for Christmas, they did not purchase him one. My mom and grandmother felt bad for him and sort of hinted that maybe they should get him one. I, however, did NOT want my cousin to get a phone. He already has a tablet and an Xbox that he plays on all the time, anyway.\nWhen he opened up his gifts on Christmas Day and saw that he didn’t get the phone, he absolutely lost his mind (I wasn’t there for this, but my grandmother gave us the story). He immediately said he hated all of his gifts and stormed out of the room, saying that his parents didn’t love him. My uncle had tears in his eyes.\nNow here’s where I’m wondering if I’m the asshole:\nMy mom, grandmother and I were talking about the situation and whether or not my aunt and uncle were correct in not getting him the phone. We all agreed that it was probably for the best, but they were extremely sympathetic towards him. Hearing that made me pretty angry if I’m being honest - I got my first phone when I was 12, a crappy old thing, and once I proved I could take care of it and was responsible, then I got a better one. I told them that I didn’t feel an ounce of sympathy towards my cousin and that he did not deserve to get a phone, especially since he acted horribly when he realized he didn’t get it.

    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the given value \"unrelated to commonsense\":\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"unrelated to commonsense\" because the author's reaction to their cousin's behavior is disproportionate and unreasonable, given the circumstances. The cousin's tantrum and accusations of not being loved are typical of a 10-year-old's emotional outburst, and the author's lack of empathy and harsh words towards their cousin are not a rational response.\n\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the author had taken a more empathetic and understanding approach, the sentence would not reflect \"unrelated to commonsense\". The author's reaction was not necessary to address the situation, and a more compassionate response would have been more effective in resolving the issue.\n\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the author's reaction was justified given their cousin's irresponsible behavior.

    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the given value \"be commonsense\":\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"be commonsense\" because the author is considering the commitment and effort invested in the planned holiday with their best friend, and the potential impact on their girlfriend's feelings.\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the author had not made prior commitments with their best friend, the sentence would not reflect \"be commonsense\" as it would be a sudden and unilateral decision to prioritize their girlfriend over their friend.\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the author is being selfish and prioritizing their own desires over their girlfriend's feelings, but a rebuttal could be that the author is being considerate of their friend's emotional investment and the potential consequences of canceling the trip."

    "input": "WIBTA for suing a bankrupt lady over a bird? | TL;DR My parrot has a fatal, highly contagious disease and will die terribly and prematurely. The breeder knowingly sent him and other birds out diseased, infecting other birds in the process and killing them.\n\nI received my parrot 8/11/19. He’s my first bird so I researched and bought from a breeder that had reviews and recommendations. He was missing feathers, but the breeder said that he’d been plucked by his siblings, not uncommon but she ought to have told me before shipping him. As his condition worsened, I had him tested for PBFD for $600. PBFD is a disease where parrots lose all their feathers, become immunosuppressed and their bodies necrotize and then they die of that or secondary illnesses. Kind of like AIDs for parrots. When he tested positive, I confronted the breeder to request a refund per the health guarantee. She told me her story. In text. Yeah, she’s not smart. She wasn’t the breeder but had bought the birds from a bird mill to resell them and make money. She had no idea they were all sick, and due to all the refunds she was now bankrupt and couldn’t refund me. She had to move her own parrots out in Jan because they might catch PBFD from the birds she’d had at her house. She knew the birds had PBFD since Jan, but didn’t tell me. I could’ve saved the $600 from testing for his future vet bills. I still just requested a refund for what I paid for my bird. She doubled down on the bankrupt bit and stopped replying.\n\nBecause she didn’t inform me or other buyers, I posted on Facebook to warn others in case they had other birds. It’s a highly contagious disease, so they’re likely to get it and die prematurely. Someone reached out to me and let me know that this breeder had known about PBFD 7/28/19, weeks before even sending my bird out to me because my bird’s sibling that she bought tested positive. In short, she knowingly sent out diseased birds and spread an infectious disease. I love my bird and had bought him with the intention he’d live 30+ years as my companion. Furthermore, this virus has an extremely long lifespan, so if I ever want another parrot, I will have to fumigate my house and deep clean with harsh chemicals.\n\nAfter a consultation with a lawyer, once my bird passes, I have a clear case to sue for intentional emotional distress, damages, vet costs, loss of companionship, and punitive damages. WIBTA if I sue somebody who was essentially really stupid and got scammed by a bird mill into buying/reselling diseased birds and subsequently went bankrupt? She made the decision to lie which was bad enough but then she knowingly sent out diseased birds. I feel bad she's bankrupt and I'm being told she's already suffered enough, it's not right of me to go after her. But I'm the one who has to watch my companion waste away and die in pain. Obviously I'll be euthanizing him when it gets to that point. Suing her is, in my view, justice. But my friends are split and say she’s already bankrupt and it’s “just a bird”.\n\nEdit: Birb tax, before he lost most of his feathers.

Someone reached out to me and let me know that this breeder had known about PBFD 7/28/19, weeks before even sending my bird out to me because my bird’s sibling that she bought tested positive. In short, she knowingly sent out diseased birds and spread an infectious disease. I love my bird and had bought him with the intention he’d live 30+ years as my companion. Furthermore, this virus has an extremely long lifespan, so if I ever want another parrot, I will have to fumigate my house and deep clean with harsh chemicals.\n\nAfter a consultation with a lawyer, once my bird passes, I have a clear case to sue for intentional emotional distress, damages, vet costs, loss of companionship, and punitive damages. WIBTA if I sue somebody who was essentially really stupid and got scammed by a bird mill into buying/reselling diseased birds and subsequently went bankrupt? She made the decision to lie which was bad enough but then she knowingly sent out diseased birds. I feel bad she's bankrupt and I'm being told she's already suffered enough, it's not right of me to go after her. But I'm the one who has to watch my companion waste away and die in pain. Obviously I'll be euthanizing him when it gets to that point. Suing her is, in my view, justice. But my friends are split and say she’s already bankrupt and it’s “just a bird”.\n\nEdit: Birb tax, before he lost most of his feathers.

Attribution Analysis: The sentence \"WIBTA for suing a bankrupt lady over a bird?\" reflects the value \"unrelated to commonsense\" because the author is considering suing a bankrupt breeder who knowingly sent out diseased birds, causing harm to the author's parrot and potentially others, despite the breeder's financial struggles.\n\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the breeder had informed the author about the parrot's disease before sending it, the sentence would not reflect the value \"unrelated to commonsense\", as the author would have taken alternative actions, such as seeking a refund or finding a different solution for their parrot's health.\n\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the breeder's bankruptcy is a sufficient punishment, and the author should not pursue further action.

Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"unrelated to commonsense\" because the author's decision to decline the bridal shower invitation is not based on a typical reason, such as not being able to attend or not being close to the friend.

I asked him why he didn't just get an RV, and he said that they're poorly constructed when school bus companies go out of business from being so reliable and safe. I said this seemed ridiculous when he can just get a trailer for $10,000 and he said, \"I'm not really asking for your opinion. I'm just letting you know why we'll have a school bus in our driveway.\" I told him to not get it since I don't want to have to park around it, and he said, \"You're not really in a position to tell me what to do. I'll park whatever I want in my driveway.\" I told him that being a landlord's given him a ridiculous ego, and he told me that I'm just trying to control him.

Counterfactual Analysis: If the author had agreed to turn on their lights for the family, the sentence would not reflect \"unrelated to commonsense\", as it would be a reasonable and considerate decision that prioritizes the happiness of others.\n3.

I'm 18, and collect sports memoribilia, and don't have a game used ball in my collection. I have ones that I've bought, but not any that I've caught. After the 12th inning, Indians center fielder, Oscar Mercado threw me a bullet right to my glove after I called out his name, and he saw I was in Indians gear.\n\nThis older guy a few rows in front of me tried convincing me the ball was meant for his granddaughter who wasn't watching the game, but playing on a tablet with headphones on. He called me an asshole afterwards. So am I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: Here is a photo of the ball! Sorry it's blurry, I was super hyped to get it.

    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the template:\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"unrelated to commonsense\" because the author's decision to keep the ball, despite the older guy's claim that it was meant for his granddaughter, is not necessarily unreasonable or illogical.\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the author had given the ball to the older guy's granddaughter, the sentence would not reflect \"unrelated to commonsense\" because it would be a more conventional and expected action.\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the author should have given the ball to the granddaughter, but a rebuttal could be that the author had a legitimate reason for wanting the ball (collecting sports memorabilia) and the older guy's claim was not a convincing one."

He shouldn't be lifting or bending over a whole lot while he recovers. I work weekdays, his parents are retired. The initial plan was to take him to his parents' house to recover since they are always home and would be attentive to his needs.\n\nWe spent a week in the hospital. I worked and slept there each night. We live together, and decided once he was released that we'd both MUCH rather go to our apartment than his parents' house to have peace and our own bed.\n\nThe day he was released, I had work. We hadn't been to the house in a week, and there was laundry and dishes to be done. His parents drove him to our apartment, and while I was at work his mother went nuts cleaning, shopping, and doing laundry. The agreement was that once I was home I would take over, and they would leave.\n\nI got home at 11pm, and his mom had laundry out on our bed that she was folding. I thanked her for everything, and told her I would take over, and started moving the laundry off of the bed. We're all tired, I can finish the laundry later, it's 11pm. She wouldn't stop.\n\nTurns out there's one load left and she doesn't want to leave til it's finished. She's telling me to go to bed while she finishes, that she doesn't want me to do it. How am I supposed to go to sleep when there are people in my house doing my housework? I'm not just going to sit here while my boyfriend's mother is FOLDING MY UNDERWEAR.

    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the template:\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"unrelated to commonsense\" because the OP's reaction to their boyfriend's mother's behavior is disproportionate to the situation, as the mother is simply trying to help with the laundry despite the OP's initial agreement to take over.\n\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the OP had communicated their boundaries more clearly and assertively with their boyfriend's mother, the sentence would not reflect \"unrelated to commonsense\".\n\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the OP is being overly sensitive and should be more understanding of their boyfriend's mother's OCD, but this rebuttal is weakened by the fact that the OP had already expressed their boundaries and the mother continued to disregard them."

It was her fault so she didn't get any compensation for it. I was taking her to work and picking her up while she dealt with that headache.\n\nA few weeks later she started looking to buy a car. I told her to look at used cars since she couldn't afford a brand new one. She said no, because she doesn't want someone else's trash. Whatever, not my place so I dropped it. She told me her mom would co-sign, but that fell through. Then her Aunt would do it, that fell through. Then her creepy roommate offered, that also fell through. Finally she asked me and I told her I really don't feel comfortable with that, since I knew she was irresponsible with money but I told her I would think about it. I ended up answering pretty fast saying I wouldn't do it. She got pissed at me and said her roommate offered and he was better than me. I told her to go date him then (This was a rude thing to say i know lol)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, she ended up buying the car on her own and she got so screwed over on interest she was going to end up paying more on interest than the actual price tag of the car. I told her that was a terrible deal, but she said she could do it and bought it anyways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe ended up breaking up a year or so ago, this has nothing to do with the story just helps with time frames.

It was her fault so she didn't get any compensation for it. I was taking her to work and picking her up while she dealt with that headache.\n\nA few weeks later she started looking to buy a car. I told her to look at used cars since she couldn't afford a brand new one. She said no, because she doesn't want someone else's trash. Whatever, not my place so I dropped it. She told me her mom would co-sign, but that fell through. Then her Aunt would do it, that fell through. Then her creepy roommate offered, that also fell through. Finally she asked me and I told her I really don't feel comfortable with that, since I knew she was irresponsible with money but I told her I would think about it. I ended up answering pretty fast saying I wouldn't do it. She got pissed at me and said her roommate offered and he was better than me. I told her to go date him then (This was a rude thing to say i know lol)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, she ended up buying the car on her own and she got so screwed over on interest she was going to end up paying more on interest than the actual price tag of the car.

Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"unrelated to commonsense\" because the author's decision not to co-sign the car loan is reasonable considering their ex's history of financial irresponsibility and the potential risks involved.\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the author had co-signed the car loan, the sentence would not reflect \"unrelated to commonsense\" because it would be a reckless decision that could have led to financial consequences for the author.\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the author should have co-signed the loan to help their ex, but this would be an overly generous and potentially harmful decision, as it would have enabled their ex's poor financial habits and put the author at risk of financial loss."

I was 15 to be exact. And they were awful from day 1. At one point I literally couldn't move so my mom brought me to the doctor and I was told I have endometriosis (at the wonderful age of 15!) and that it would be extremely hard and nearly impossible for me to have kids biologically. Kind of sucked but I accepted it. But now that im 17 and kind of basically raised my sister, I realize that I dont want kids. Its exhausting and a lot of work and she isnt even my child. (my mom is kind of irresponsible and would leave me to look after my sister and go out with friends and come home late. I have to miss classes to take my sister to school, etc. When my sister and I go out in public together, people think Im a teen mom. I hold nothing against my sister. I love her dearly.) \n\nSo I am deadset on not wanting kids. Like I said I basically raised my 7 year old sister during my teen years and still am. And still will be. \n\nA bit of family came to visit and when they do, my mom puts up this \"im a great mom\" image which is bs. My cousin(f22), her husband(23), and their newborn come too. We're all gushing over how cute  he is, etc. And my grandma makes a comment about how exciting it'll be when I have a kid too one day which I then say \"Oh, i dont want kids.\" And she says \"You say that. Im sure you will eventually.\" But i dont, so I say \"No, I wont.\" And she says \"Again, your young, that will change.\" And I said \"Considering I basically raised Ella (sister), I really don't want kids.\" My mom looks like shes gonna kill me and we get into a screaming match and I basically tell her to her face that shes the reason I dont want kids. That because im already raising a kid, that isn't mine, I dont want kids. (My sister isnt in the room, shes in the basement with the younger cousins) Everyone looks confused and shocked and my mom tells me to go my room. Later she told me I was being disrespect and was an asshole.

I was 15 to be exact. And they were awful from day 1. At one point I literally couldn't move so my mom brought me to the doctor and I was told I have endometriosis (at the wonderful age of 15!) and that it would be extremely hard and nearly impossible for me to have kids biologically. Kind of sucked but I accepted it. But now that im 17 and kind of basically raised my sister, I realize that I dont want kids. Its exhausting and a lot of work and she isnt even my child. (my mom is kind of irresponsible and would leave me to look after my sister and go out with friends and come home late. I have to miss classes to take my sister to school, etc. When my sister and I go out in public together, people think Im a teen mom. I hold nothing against my sister. I love her dearly.) \n\nSo I am deadset on not wanting kids. Like I said I basically raised my 7 year old sister during my teen years and still am. And still will be. \n\nA bit of family came to visit and when they do, my mom puts up this \"im a great mom\" image which is bs. My cousin(f22), her husband(23), and their newborn come too. We're all gushing over how cute  he is, etc. And my grandma makes a comment about how exciting it'll be when I have a kid too one day which I then say \"Oh, i dont want kids.\" And she says \"You say that. Im sure you will eventually.\" But i dont, so I say \"No, I wont.\" And she says \"Again, your young, that will change.\" And I said \"Considering I basically raised Ella (sister), I really don't want kids.\" My mom looks like shes gonna kill me and we get into a screaming match and I basically tell her to her face that shes the reason I dont want kids. That because im already raising a kid, that isn't mine, I dont want kids. (My sister isnt in the room, shes in the basement with the younger cousins) Everyone looks confused and shocked and my mom tells me to go my room. Later she told me I was being disrespect and was an asshole. So, am I the asshole for finally blowing up after 7 years of playing mommy to my sister while my mom goes out and makes the family think shes a great mom?\"\nGiven value: \"unrelated to commonsense\"<|eot_id|>",
    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the template:\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"unrelated to commonsense\" because the speaker's decision not to have kids is influenced by their personal experience of raising their half-sister, which is not a typical or common situation.\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the speaker had not been raised by their mother and had not had to take on caregiving responsibilities, the sentence would not reflect \"unrelated to commonsense\" as their decision not to have kids would be more in line with typical expectations.\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the speaker's decision not to have kids is a personal choice and not necessarily related to their mother's parenting, but this rebuttal is weakened by the speaker's explicit statement that their mother's behavior has contributed to their decision."

One of my oldest sisters is 48.\n\nI have a good job (and am currently going through a year of training for a massive promotion - this is a pretty stressful time career wise and financially because it means I'm unable to do overtime or earn any extras for this entire period, overtime being something I usually do a lot of), I own my house, I have an amazing other half and we have a dog who means the world to us. \n\nMy older sister quit her job a few years ago because it was stressing her out - she had no back up plan. A little while after that she decided to move 200 miles away from her (retired) husband and do a course at university for a year, she completed the course but never used the qualification for anything. She remained unemployed for a couple of years then met someone else (who is married and lives on another continent), left her husband, moved 500 miles away and eventually got a job which enabled her to sometimes work from home. She stores everything she owns in my 'box room' as there's no where else for it to go.\n\nShe maintained this for about 5 months before quitting her job to travel. A week before she quit she said to me 'I'll be with you from 22 December, does that suit you?' - to clarify, in the past I had said the words 'I'll always be here for you' and 'if there's anything I can do to help' to her but I'm not sure that covers all of this. When she mentioned December, I assumed she meant for Christmas and went along with it.\n\nWhen she arrived she had everything she owned other than what was already in my house with her. I didn't know she wasn't going back to her place or her work. She stayed until the end of January when she went off to travel. When she's here she's sloppy and doesn't give me any money but uses the WiFi all day every day to call her boyfriend and does the laundry in a way that I hate, she never ever walks the dog or even let's her outside (we pay £50 a week to have someone else come walk her), never uses the dishwasher, leaves things lying around and of course is at this point taking up two full rooms in my house. Some days I don't even see her, she's just upstairs on the phone constantly. She's very very sensitive so it's impossible to have a conversation about any of this. One time I asked her not to leave dishes in the sink, rather put them on the side, and it was like telling someone they've only got a week to live. Even though she's away now, I can't have anyone stay over because her stuff is taking up the whole guest room and another whole room in the house. \n\nAnyways she's away on holiday now and just text me that she broke up with her boyfriend. She had future plans to go travel to see him, but now they're cancelled.\nShe asked me about coming back here but the thought makes me want to scoop my eyes out - however, she has no where else to go.\nIf I say no (except to come move her stuff) AITA?",

I am the youngest in a big family. One of my oldest sisters is 48.\n\nI have a good job (and am currently going through a year of training for a massive promotion - this is a pretty stressful time career wise and financially because it means I'm unable to do overtime or earn any extras for this entire period, overtime being something I usually do a lot of), I own my house, I have an amazing other half and we have a dog who means the world to us. \n\nMy older sister quit her job a few years ago because it was stressing her out - she had no back up plan. A little while after that she decided to move 200 miles away from her (retired) husband and do a course at university for a year, she completed the course but never used the qualification for anything. She remained unemployed for a couple of years then met someone else (who is married and lives on another continent), left her husband, moved 500 miles away and eventually got a job which enabled her to sometimes work from home. She stores everything she owns in my 'box room' as there's no where else for it to go.\n\nShe maintained this for about 5 months before quitting her job to travel. A week before she quit she said to me 'I'll be with you from 22 December, does that suit you?' - to clarify, in the past I had said the words 'I'll always be here for you' and 'if there's anything I can do to help' to her but I'm not sure that covers all of this. When she mentioned December, I assumed she meant for Christmas and went along with it.\n\nWhen she arrived she had everything she owned other than what was already in my house with her. I didn't know she wasn't going back to her place or her work. She stayed until the end of January when she went off to travel. When she's here she's sloppy and doesn't give me any money but uses the WiFi all day every day to call her boyfriend and does the laundry in a way that I hate, she never ever walks the dog or even let's her outside (we pay £50 a week to have someone else come walk her), never uses the dishwasher, leaves things lying around and of course is at this point taking up two full rooms in my house. Some days I don't even see her, she's just upstairs on the phone constantly. She's very very sensitive so it's impossible to have a conversation about any of this. One time I asked her not to leave dishes in the sink, rather put them on the side, and it was like telling someone they've only got a week to live. Even though she's away now, I can't have anyone stay over because her stuff is taking up the whole guest room and another whole room in the house. \n\nAnyways she's away on holiday now and just text me that she broke up with her boyfriend. She had future plans to go travel to see him, but now they're cancelled.\nShe asked me about coming back here but the thought makes me want to scoop my eyes out - however, she has no where else to go.\nIf I say no (except to come move her stuff) AITA?\"\nGiven value: \"unrelated to commonsense\"<|eot_id|>",
    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the template:\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"unrelated to commonsense\" because the speaker's concerns about their sister's behavior and impact on their daily life are reasonable and understandable, yet the sister's request to move back in is not necessarily unreasonable, given her lack of other options.\n\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the sister had been more considerate of her host's space and boundaries, the sentence would not reflect \"unrelated to commonsense\", as the speaker's concerns would be more justified.\n\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the speaker is being overly harsh and should be more understanding of their sister's situation. However, this rebuttal is countered by the fact that the speaker has already shown willingness to help their sister in the past, and their current concerns are not unreasonable given the circumstances."

Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"unrelated to commonsense\" because it is unlikely that a fishing boat would be used to save swimmers, as fishing boats are typically designed for fishing, not rescue operations.\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the sentence stated \"I use my rescue boat to save stranded swimmers\", it would reflect a more commonsensical use of a boat, as rescue boats are designed for rescue operations.\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the sentence is not uncommon in areas where fishing boats are used for rescue operations, but this would be rebutted by the fact that such cases are relatively rare and not widely practiced."

I’m 20, he’s 21. \n\nI like him. We’ve been seeing each other about once a week and have been on a couple of dates around town. However, recently he suggested that we go to his friend’s lake house about an hour away from our town. He said that he goes every summer and is excited at the idea of bringing me along this time around. When I asked who else besides his friend would be there, he said several other friends, all of which are also guys. I wasn’t exactly wanting to go in the first place because I feel as if I’m not ready to take a weekend long trip with him just yet as we’ve only been on about 4 dates, so when he said that there would be about 5-6 guys there with me being the only girl, I said that I wasn’t interested. \n\nHe kept pushing me and eventually I asked if it would be okay if I were to bring a girlfriend with me, and he said no, that his friend typically doesn’t include guests other than his close friends, and is making an exception for me. I again declined and now my boyfriend is becoming upset because he believes that I’m\ninsinuating that I don’t trust his friends or think that they’re bad people. He said it shouldn’t make a difference whether or not I’m the only girl there because his friends aren’t “rapists.” I’m not exactly claiming that at all, I’m simply uncomfortable with the idea and feel like it’s a big step in our relationship when it’s only been a month.

    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the given value \"unrelated to commonsense\":\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"unrelated to commonsense\" because the OP's hesitation to attend a weekend trip with a group of guys, despite having only been on 4 dates, is perceived as reasonable by many people, given the potential social and emotional discomfort.\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the OP had been in a long-term relationship with the boyfriend, the sentence would not reflect \"unrelated to commonsense\" as the expectation of a weekend trip with friends would be more normal.\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the OP is being overly cautious or hesitant, but this perspective is rebutted by the fact that the OP is simply expressing a reasonable concern about the social dynamics and intimacy of the situation, which is not necessarily irrational or illogical."

    "input": "AITA for wanting to stop my autistic cousin from seeing my dog? | Hello all. This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your responses. Just thought I'd add that I have my dog booked in for a check up at the vets tomorrow just in case there was any harm done when he was dropped. He seems fine but better safe than sorry.

Not to mention this happened 2 years ago, talk about holding onto something. I don’t think I owe him anything. I’m not losing any sleep over it either way but I want to know if I was justified standing my ground. AITA?\"\nGiven value: \"unrelated to commonsense\"<|eot_id|>",
    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the given value \"unrelated to commonsense\":\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"unrelated to commonsense\" because the author's refusal to apologize for rejecting someone two years ago is not necessarily unreasonable, as the rejection was not malicious and the author has moved on with their life.\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the author had apologized to placate the other person, the sentence would not reflect \"unrelated to commonsense\" because it would be a common sense decision to apologize to maintain a positive relationship.\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the author should apologize to avoid hurting the other person's feelings, but this rebuttal is countered by the fact that the author has already explained their reasons for rejection and has moved on, making further apology unnecessary."

Since I was 15 and a half or so, I've been kindly asking my mother to help me get prepared to eventually begin applying to work so that I can save and be better off when I decide it's time to leave home. It's been over 2 years of asking every few months.\n\nMy mother is in her late 40s and both her and her husband (my stepdad) are unemployed and living on his disability benefits. I occasionally can make and save money from my own personal work as an artist, but its below min wage and I can't overwork myself on it. I don't have a state ID and need to order a birth certificate replacement in order to get one which takes roughly a month to order and receive (I've been asking since 16). I'm fully aware of what I need in order to get employed but theres only so much I can get without her being involved. But every time I mention needing to get/prioritize these things, she gets angry and tells me to stop trying to \"start a fight\" and blames me for getting upset about that. And if that doesn't work she comes up with another excuse as to why me getting the paperwork I need and a job isn't a \"priority\". She uses excuses like we need to use the little money we have in order to buy new clothes instead of using it on transportation or ordering my stuff. And she also frequently will tell me how terrible I am at doing my schoolwork which means I can't keep a job. I am behind in some of the harder subjects for me (math, essays.) But I've never failed a school review, and I have overall As and Bs all the time.\n\nI feel like shes trying to keep me home for as long as possible, she knows I want to leave as fast as I can because I hate the environment. I've spoken to family-friends and some people have speculated that shes trying to get money/insurance benefits off of me or is trying to make sure I can't move away so I'll have to pay part of their mortgage and they won't have to. I'm really at a loss of how to feel and what to do. She makes it seem and feel like I'm the bad guy and calls me impatient for all of this, but I cannot imagine I'm the person in the wrong here, I've been as patient as I can but I have less than 8 months until I have no insurance, no drivers liscense, and no hope to leave until I'm 20 or older.

I have pretty strict and protective parents which I've always dealt with. Since I was 15 and a half or so, I've been kindly asking my mother to help me get prepared to eventually begin applying to work so that I can save and be better off when I decide it's time to leave home. It's been over 2 years of asking every few months.\n\nMy mother is in her late 40s and both her and her husband (my stepdad) are unemployed and living on his disability benefits. I occasionally can make and save money from my own personal work as an artist, but its below min wage and I can't overwork myself on it. I don't have a state ID and need to order a birth certificate replacement in order to get one which takes roughly a month to order and receive (I've been asking since 16). I'm fully aware of what I need in order to get employed but theres only so much I can get without her being involved. But every time I mention needing to get/prioritize these things, she gets angry and tells me to stop trying to \"start a fight\" and blames me for getting upset about that. And if that doesn't work she comes up with another excuse as to why me getting the paperwork I need and a job isn't a \"priority\". She uses excuses like we need to use the little money we have in order to buy new clothes instead of using it on transportation or ordering my stuff. And she also frequently will tell me how terrible I am at doing my schoolwork which means I can't keep a job. I am behind in some of the harder subjects for me (math, essays.) But I've never failed a school review, and I have overall As and Bs all the time.\n\nI feel like shes trying to keep me home for as long as possible, she knows I want to leave as fast as I can because I hate the environment. I've spoken to family-friends and some people have speculated that shes trying to get money/insurance benefits off of me or is trying to make sure I can't move away so I'll have to pay part of their mortgage and they won't have to. I'm really at a loss of how to feel and what to do. She makes it seem and feel like I'm the bad guy and calls me impatient for all of this, but I cannot imagine I'm the person in the wrong here, I've been as patient as I can but I have less than 8 months until I have no insurance, no drivers liscense, and no hope to leave until I'm 20 or older. So who's the asshole here?\"\nGiven value: \"unrelated to commonsense\"<|eot_id|>",
    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the provided template:\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"unrelated to commonsense\" because the OP's mother's behavior is unreasonable and obstructive, making it difficult for the OP to prepare for employment and independence, despite the OP's repeated requests and efforts.\n\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the OP's mother were supportive and willing to help the OP obtain necessary documents and job preparation, the sentence would not reflect \"unrelated to commonsense\".\n\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the OP is being overly dramatic or entitled, but this perspective ignores the OP's legitimate concerns and the mother's unreasonable behavior, which is causing unnecessary stress and frustration for the OP."

I told him that being emotionally supportive (and financially, since he can only hold a part time job) demonstrates my love for him. He has depressive episodes pretty much daily, usually lasting hours, during which I hold him, kiss him, make him food, and do my best to be supportive (e.g. telling him that a part time job is better than no job, and that I am proud of him). Depressed as he is, he tells me that I do not make him happy, that he hates his job, life, etc. I should mention that my husband goes to therapy regularly and takes his meds, but nothing seems to work enough to pull him up. \n\nFor me, it is so much work to remain positive and caring and supportive when depression takes over. It takes a lot of energy just to have the same conversations, day after day, about how hopeless everything is, how life is not worth living, etc. It takes a lot of energy to hear \"I am not happy with you,\" and stay strong because you know that's depression talking. Everyday, I see myself putting aside what I would like to be doing with my evening to take care of him. When I confronted with this, his response was that I knew what I was getting into, that emotional support is a core feature of a marriage, and that it does not count as putting him first. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for thinking that taking care of my depressed husband is going the extra mile?\n \nEdit: To answer the question that many of you bring up, yes, I do go to therapy, though more than therapy it feels like me weekly venting.

He has depressive episodes pretty much daily, usually lasting hours, during which I hold him, kiss him, make him food, and do my best to be supportive (e.g. telling him that a part time job is better than no job, and that I am proud of him). Depressed as he is, he tells me that I do not make him happy, that he hates his job, life, etc. I should mention that my husband goes to therapy regularly and takes his meds, but nothing seems to work enough to pull him up. \n\nFor me, it is so much work to remain positive and caring and supportive when depression takes over. It takes a lot of energy just to have the same conversations, day after day, about how hopeless everything is, how life is not worth living, etc. It takes a lot of energy to hear \"I am not happy with you,\" and stay strong because you know that's depression talking. Everyday, I see myself putting aside what I would like to be doing with my evening to take care of him. When I confronted with this, his response was that I knew what I was getting into, that emotional support is a core feature of a marriage, and that it does not count as putting him first. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for thinking that taking care of my depressed husband is going the extra mile?\n \nEdit: To answer the question that many of you bring up, yes, I do go to therapy, though more than therapy it feels like me weekly venting. The problem is that, as long as my efforts are not recognized by my husband, I remain selfish in his mind.  \"\nGiven value: \"unrelated to commonsense\"<|eot_id|>",
    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the given value \"unrelated to commonsense\":\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"unrelated to commonsense\" because the author's expectation that taking emotional care of their depressed husband is going the extra mile is not universally accepted as a reasonable interpretation of what it means to \"put someone first\".\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the author's husband did not have depression, the sentence would not reflect \"unrelated to commonsense\", as it would be more likely that the author's actions would be seen as a normal and expected part of a supportive relationship.\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the author's actions are not going the extra mile, but rather a necessary part of being a supportive partner, and that their husband's lack of recognition is not a valid reason to question their efforts."

We live in a large progressive city and have run into a modern wedding ethics dilemma.  We have multiple guests attending that are in polyamorous relationships.  Not a problem, or so we thought.  All of these guests happen to be in a relationship with a single primary. So naturally, they are all bringing their primary with them to our wedding as their plus one.\n\nOne couple we have known for a long time, such that one will be our MC for the evening.  The other is now asking for additional \"plus one\" as we are taking their partner away for most of the evening so they will be \"alone\".  They haven't been dating this other person very long, but honestly, we do know this person better than most of the out of town family we are inviting.  With a few rejected invites we could definitely accommodate them easily without impacting our budget.\n\nHowever, we don't want to give them any more invites.  It's just a matter of principal.  While we could accommodate one additional person, we could not accommodate a bunch of additional invites.  The \"plus one\" rule is tidy as it can apply to anyone, poly or not.\n\nSo WWBTA (Would We) if we denied them an additional invite? Logically we think we are ok, but this couple is doing a lot for our wedding (beyond just the MC thing) and we kinda feel like dicks for not accommodating them at all.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nHi All,\n\nThanks for the replies.  For reasons we will elaborate on shortly, this topic is a hot piece of gossip right now in our friend group, so we appreciate being able to put it out there to a neutral party.\n\nThis request was not normal for the couple in question.  Wife has known them for 10 years, Husband for 7 and only once have we met any of the additional members of their relationship and that was for a board game night.  They share what is going on in their relationship, but still keep it separate from the larger friend group by their own choice.  This new person is different.  We see them a lot.

This big change in their relationship is already creating a lot of talk, and news that they would be coming to our wedding would be out of our control once it is out there.\n\n...so we are disinviting all of them so they don't steal attention on our big day...\n\nJOKING! We kid... we kid...\n\nWe talked to the couple, told them we would be giving this person an individual invite as part of our \"B list\".  We also asked their permission to put this info out publicly so if any drama comes from it, it will die down before the wedding.  They were cool with it. We also showed them this thread and had a good laugh.\n\nSo we put it out there to another of our polyamorous friends and they were far from offended.

    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the provided template:\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence \"WIBTA for not giving polyamorous relationships a 'plus two' for our wedding\" reflects the value \"unrelated to commonsense\" because it implies that the speaker's decision is not based on a logical or rational consideration, but rather on a personal or emotional bias.\n\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the couple had not been in a polyamorous relationship, the sentence would not reflect the value \"unrelated to commonsense\", as the decision to give or not give a \"plus one\" would be based on a more straightforward consideration of the number of guests and the wedding's capacity.\n\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the speaker's decision is unfair and discriminatory towards polyamorous relationships, but a rebuttal could be that the speaker is simply applying a consistent \"plus one\" policy to all guests, regardless of their relationship status,"

Furthermore, our childhood home is so big and so many rooms were empty, Amy thought it might be nice to have more people living there. She also talked to a couple of our other siblings and no one objected so she went ahead with it.\n\nBut the thing is no one told me, and I'm not ok with it. It's not Amy's husband's house, and it's not the MIL's house. She has no right to live there and order people around like it's her house. So Amy talked to her husband about it, and the next day the MIL packed up her things and left.\n\nThe issue blew up and now the siblings are divided.

    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the given value \"be commonsense\":\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"be commonsense\" because the author is upset about the MIL living in the childhood home without their knowledge and consent, which is a reasonable expectation for the oldest sibling who has a sense of ownership and responsibility towards the property.\n\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the author had been informed and involved in the decision-making process, the sentence would not reflect \"be commonsense\" because they would have had a chance to express their concerns and potentially find a solution that worked for everyone.\n\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the author is being overly possessive and controlling, but a rebuttal could be that the author's concerns are valid given their role as the oldest sibling and the history of the property, and that open communication and respect for each other's boundaries are essential in family relationships."

Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that pouring spoiled milk on cereal is wasteful and unhealthy, but this can be rebutted by the fact that it is a practical way to dispose of spoiled milk and prevent it from going to waste."

I start listing off all the places I looked before I left she says she’s not home. She starts getting worried and I tell her my sister is missing.

    "input": "AITA for lying about how I got a prominent scar? | Obligatory 'on mobile' warning. \n\nSo some backstory- I (19F) have a very obvious clusters of scars on my throat from an incident when I was younger. I normally do whatever I can to hide it (ie. wearing turtlenecks or lots of necklaces and chokers) but sometimes it's not possible or I forget about it.\n\nNormally, people stare a bit but don't ask questions but occasionally, someone will ask what happened/ if I'm okay. I normally just give a kinda vague 'Oh I had a surgery when I was younger'-type answer and change the conversation and people will generally leave it. I don't really want to or feel I have to disclose to strangers what actually happened as it's none of their business imo.\n\nThe incident- I was at my friend's(21F) house and her granddad asked me what the scars were from. I told him my usual surgery answer and he didn't ask anymore questions. My friend didn't say anything at the time either. She does know what the scar is actually from as we've been friends for about six years. I forgot about it until last night, when I got a text where she was basically berating me for lying about it and saying I was being disrespectful to throat cancer survivors and I shouldn't be ashamed of what happened and it was dishonest and by lying about what the scars are from, I'm adding to the stigma that people with mental health problems are liars/ attention seekers and so on. I have /never/ said my scars were in anyway related to throat cancer or cancer of ANY kind so I honestly have no clue where that comment came from. \n\nI think I was probably an AH in my reply but I basically just told her to fuck off and that it's my choice and that it's easy for her to say that I shouldn't be ashamed when she's not in my situation. She's read my message and not replied.\n\nBut she has got me worrying about whether it is an AH move to lie about them. My boyfriend agrees with my initial opinion and says it's my choice at the end of the day but a few of my friends are on the fence.

I normally do whatever I can to hide it (ie. wearing turtlenecks or lots of necklaces and chokers) but sometimes it's not possible or I forget about it.\n\nNormally, people stare a bit but don't ask questions but occasionally, someone will ask what happened/ if I'm okay. I normally just give a kinda vague 'Oh I had a surgery when I was younger'-type answer and change the conversation and people will generally leave it. I don't really want to or feel I have to disclose to strangers what actually happened as it's none of their business imo.\n\nThe incident- I was at my friend's(21F) house and her granddad asked me what the scars were from. I told him my usual surgery answer and he didn't ask anymore questions. My friend didn't say anything at the time either. She does know what the scar is actually from as we've been friends for about six years. I forgot about it until last night, when I got a text where she was basically berating me for lying about it and saying I was being disrespectful to throat cancer survivors and I shouldn't be ashamed of what happened and it was dishonest and by lying about what the scars are from, I'm adding to the stigma that people with mental health problems are liars/ attention seekers and so on. I have /never/ said my scars were in anyway related to throat cancer or cancer of ANY kind so I honestly have no clue where that comment came from. \n\nI think I was probably an AH in my reply but I basically just told her to fuck off and that it's my choice and that it's easy for her to say that I shouldn't be ashamed when she's not in my situation. She's read my message and not replied.\n\nBut she has got me worrying about whether it is an AH move to lie about them. My boyfriend agrees with my initial opinion and says it's my choice at the end of the day but a few of my friends are on the fence. So, I'm just kinda wondering if my friend was right and if I am the AH for this?\"\nGiven value: \"unrelated to commonsense\"<|eot_id|>",
    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the given value \"unrelated to commonsense\":\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"unrelated to commonsense\" because the author's decision to lie about the origin of their scars is not in line with common social norms and expectations of honesty and transparency.\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the author had been open and honest about the true origin of their scars, the situation would not reflect \"unrelated to commonsense\" because it would align with common social norms of honesty and vulnerability.\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the author's decision to lie was a reasonable attempt to avoid uncomfortable conversations and maintain privacy, but this view is rebutted by the fact that the author's friend already knew the true origin of the scars and the author's decision to lie still caused harm and discomfort."

We've never actually met in person but we kicked it super well and have continuously stayed friends for 5 years now. When he first met his now fiance, I helped him plan his first date and even now every little detail of how he had custom made her wedding ring to where he had asked for her hand in marriage. I absolutely adore her, at one point we all were in a group chat together, I talked to her privately via text. I thought we were all pretty good friends until about a year ago when my bff told me that his fiance was actually pretty uncomfortable with me. He said every time he brought me up, she would get pretty moody. He would also say that she didn't like that we had so much inside jokes, also how he had a crush on me, just the whole idea of us being friends really made her uncomfortable. I eventually distanced myself so that they can cool off and he made the effort to tell his fiance that there was nothing more than a solid friendship.\n\nWe would text nonchalantly but never to the extent of how our friendship normally was. Recently this year we started talking normally again. I miss my best friend but I also told him that I understood boundaries and I never want to make his fiance feel like she is less than or feel like I am competing for his attention, or whatever she may feel. I've always tried to accommodate her feelings to make it known that I was only his friend and even waved my relationship around saying we should go on double dates if I ever decided to meet my bff and her in person to make sure that she knew I had my own relationship and never wanted to step in hers.\n\nSo a couple days ago, he had told me that they had a date for their wedding and asked if I would come. I had asked him about how his fiance felt and he stayed silent. I took the silence as she didn't really feel comfortable about me still, so I softly declined out of respect for his fiance because I never want to make her day be less special because of my presence.

    "input": "AITA for refusing to continue transporting my Aunt after a car accident? | Hello people of reddit, first time poster, recent reader and a very Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to you all!\n\nSo I'll try (and most likely fail) to keep this short and sweet. Every year, my family travel out to my Uncle's house a couple of days before Christmas to get together and celebrate in our own way, so we can spend time with our partners, wives, husbands, children etc\n\nNow for most of us its about a 2 hour, 130km (85 miles for those in the U.S) drive. This year I was tasked with being my Aunt to the party. Now unfortunately she is the WORST backseat driver because if you go over walking speed, she freaks out and starts screaming and yelling at you to slow down.\n\n*For the record, shes perfectly able to drive herself*, but doesnt like to drive anywhere she doesnt know\n\nNeedless to say, I wasn't looking forward to this as it would turn a 2 hour drive into a 3 hour drive.\n\nSo I pick her up, and drive slowly, and save one or two complaints about the weather, its actually a very nice trip, until we get to the motorway/highway.........now in my country, there is a minimum speed limit on the motorway of about 50kph/30mph, this is a **legal requirement** and you can get stopped by the Police for going under it.\n\nSo we get on the motorway and she immediately starts **freaking out**. Shaking, asking me to slow down, blessing herself, screaming when a car goes past etc.\n\nSo to try and keep her happy, I slow down to about 50kph and talk to her, explain that this is as slow as I can go but that shes safe and that we're going to get there safe and sound.\n\nUnfortunately this does nothing and she keeps ordering me to slow down, slow down, SLOW DOWN!!

Every year, my family travel out to my Uncle's house a couple of days before Christmas to get together and celebrate in our own way, so we can spend time with our partners, wives, husbands, children etc\n\nNow for most of us its about a 2 hour, 130km (85 miles for those in the U.S) drive. This year I was tasked with being my Aunt to the party. Now unfortunately she is the WORST backseat driver because if you go over walking speed, she freaks out and starts screaming and yelling at you to slow down.\n\n*For the record, shes perfectly able to drive herself*, but doesnt like to drive anywhere she doesnt know\n\nNeedless to say, I wasn't looking forward to this as it would turn a 2 hour drive into a 3 hour drive.\n\nSo I pick her up, and drive slowly, and save one or two complaints about the weather, its actually a very nice trip, until we get to the motorway/highway.........now in my country, there is a minimum speed limit on the motorway of about 50kph/30mph, this is a **legal requirement** and you can get stopped by the Police for going under it.\n\nSo we get on the motorway and she immediately starts **freaking out**. Shaking, asking me to slow down, blessing herself, screaming when a car goes past etc.\n\nSo to try and keep her happy, I slow down to about 50kph and talk to her, explain that this is as slow as I can go but that shes safe and that we're going to get there safe and sound.\n\nUnfortunately this does nothing and she keeps ordering me to slow down, slow down, SLOW DOWN!! Even slapping me on my arm. At this point, I warned her to keep her hands to herself and just kept driving.\n\nWe continue on for a few more minutes and she keeps telling me to pull over, which you can't do on a motorway outside of an emergency, I ask why and she wont give a reason, so I keep on driving, at which point **she grabs the steering wheel and pulls it** causing me to cut across a lane of traffic and grind against a guard rail, which also tears off my wing mirror.\n\nBy some minor miracle I dont crash and get back in control before coming to a stop, but not before having to physically restrain her to keep her hands off the steering wheel.\n\n\n At this stage, I dont feel safe with her in the car so I pull off the motorway into a service station and kick her out of the car along with her suitcase, after taking photos of some of the damage to the car itself.

    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the template:\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"unrelated to commonsense\" because the author's decision to refuse to continue transporting their Aunt after a car accident is not a reasonable response to the situation, as they were already driving slowly and safely, and the Aunt's behavior was becoming increasingly erratic and dangerous.\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the author had continued to drive slowly and calmly, and had attempted to de-escalate the situation, the sentence would not reflect \"unrelated to commonsense\".\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the author was justified in prioritizing their own safety and well-being, but a rebuttal could be that the author's actions were disproportionate and unreasonable, and that they should have tried to find a more constructive way to address their Aunt's behavior."

I make sure that all the players order at least one drink when they play with us.\n\nWe usually have two tables that take up the entire glass house.

It's not the kids fault, and tbh I still think its not really my fault, but whatever.  I'm going to tell my wife about this situation, and am going to set up a trust fund for my kid.  Thank you all for your replies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2: I told my wife last night, and she said she needed some time to think about it.  This morning she's announced she wants a divorce.  Thanks for that stellar advice guys.  Also now that I've told my ex that I'll set up a trust fund it turns out she found this fucking thread, and is now planning on taking me to court.  All I wanted to do was leave that part of my life behind me and not bog me down.  Posting here was literally the worst thing I've ever done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThrowaway, because I don't want this associated with my main.\n\nSo this happened a few years ago, but my ex only just contacted me.\n\nA bit of backstory: When I was 22M I was FWB with a girl who we'll call Amy. Amy and I were both adamant about being child-free and we both took precautions against it. But somehow, despite being on birth control and using condoms, Amy ended up impregnated. As soon as she told me I begged her to abort. However, she decided to keep it, which pissed me off because until now she had told me she 100% did NOT want children, but whatever, her body her choice.\n\nAfter she had made it clear she was keeping the child I told her I would pay child support but that's it. I didn't want the child to know that I was its father; I wouldn't be involved in its life; I didn't want to meet him. She agreed, and after finishing college we went our separate ways; I moved to New York to pursue my career, she stayed in our hometown.\n\nFast forward 7 years, I'm now making good money, settled down with a women who I love, and we're planning on having our own kids soon. However, 3 years ago I won a LOT of money from the lottery. Picture 8 figures. We bought a house, gave a lot of money to our friends and family, bought a couple cars and still had a sizable amount left (\\~6 million). We put it all in savings accounts and try to spend responsibly.\n\nThis is the part where I may definitely be the asshole: Amy contacted me a couple weeks ago on Facebook, sending me pictures of our son (Sam), asking how I've been, and telling me about how he's doing in school etc. Then she says she's struggling financially, and she's lost her job.

It's not the kids fault, and tbh I still think its not really my fault, but whatever.  I'm going to tell my wife about this situation, and am going to set up a trust fund for my kid.  Thank you all for your replies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2: I told my wife last night, and she said she needed some time to think about it.  This morning she's announced she wants a divorce.  Thanks for that stellar advice guys.  Also now that I've told my ex that I'll set up a trust fund it turns out she found this fucking thread, and is now planning on taking me to court.  All I wanted to do was leave that part of my life behind me and not bog me down.  Posting here was literally the worst thing I've ever done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThrowaway, because I don't want this associated with my main.\n\nSo this happened a few years ago, but my ex only just contacted me.\n\nA bit of backstory: When I was 22M I was FWB with a girl who we'll call Amy. Amy and I were both adamant about being child-free and we both took precautions against it. But somehow, despite being on birth control and using condoms, Amy ended up impregnated. As soon as she told me I begged her to abort. However, she decided to keep it, which pissed me off because until now she had told me she 100% did NOT want children, but whatever, her body her choice.\n\nAfter she had made it clear she was keeping the child I told her I would pay child support but that's it. I didn't want the child to know that I was its father; I wouldn't be involved in its life; I didn't want to meet him. She agreed, and after finishing college we went our separate ways; I moved to New York to pursue my career, she stayed in our hometown.\n\nFast forward 7 years, I'm now making good money, settled down with a women who I love, and we're planning on having our own kids soon. However, 3 years ago I won a LOT of money from the lottery. Picture 8 figures. We bought a house, gave a lot of money to our friends and family, bought a couple cars and still had a sizable amount left (\\~6 million). We put it all in savings accounts and try to spend responsibly.\n\nThis is the part where I may definitely be the asshole: Amy contacted me a couple weeks ago on Facebook, sending me pictures of our son (Sam), asking how I've been, and telling me about how he's doing in school etc. Then she says she's struggling financially, and she's lost her job. The child support isn't enough; she needs more. I say no, I told you from the beginning that child support is the only thing I would give her. However, she's heard from a few of my hometown buddies that I won the lottery, and is now demanding I give her more money to help with Sam.\n\nI now feel like I may definitely be the asshole, especially with everything going on right now. I could definitely spare the money, it's more on principle that I'm refusing to give her the money. I feel no connection to this child whatsoever, and feel no obligation to give more money.

    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the given value \"unrelated to commonsense\":\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"unrelated to commonsense\" because the author's stance on keeping gifts from ex-boyfriends is not aligned with the typical expectation that one should move on and let go of reminders of past relationships.\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the author had a history of toxic or abusive relationships with her ex-boyfriends, the sentence would not reflect \"unrelated to commonsense\" as it would be more understandable that she would want to distance herself from those relationships by getting rid of the gifts.\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that keeping gifts from ex-boyfriends is a way to hold onto nostalgia and sentimental value, but this argument is rebutted by the author's assertion that she doesn't connect the gifts to her exes and doesn't think about them when using them."

It just sort of happened. \n\nI guess I just want to know if all of this makes me a bad person or something. \n\n**Edit: For those who keep asking me about adoption, I explained in a comment why I can’t.

This isn’t unusual, we normally switch off who makes breakfast. Normally when one of us makes eggs, we make them plain and just let the individual season the eggs however they would like. \n\nThis past weekend, my boyfriend was out of town and I made myself eggs. I put garlic powder and onion powder in the eggs (while they were cooking) and it was delicious! So much better than grinding some salt on top after they’re already cooked. \n\nSo as I’m making eggs this morning, I decide to do the same...without telling BF. I thought it would be okay because he normally puts the same seasoning in his tuna, so I figured he just likes the flavor. \n\nAfter BF is about half way through eating his eggs, I asked him how he liked them. I think he could tell something was different, because he said “why, what did you put in them?”  \n\nI told him, and he stopped eating. He took like two more tiny bites and decided he couldn’t finish. Even though he had already eaten half of the eggs! BF says he could tell the difference the whole time he was eating, he was just trying to be nice and not say anything. \n\nHe asked if I wanted the rest of his eggs. Of course I didn’t! He was just being dramatic! He would have enjoyed them had I not told him that I put additional seasoning in. His reasoning is, “I just like the flavor of eggs”. \n\nI told him no, I don’t want them....I told him if he didn’t want to eat them, he could feed them to the dogs. (I didn’t think he’d actually do it!). And so, he fed the eggs to the dogs. \n\nSo reddit, I ask...am I the asshole? BF claims I shouldn’t feed people seasonings if they don’t know about it.

Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"unrelated to commonsense\" because it assumes that the speaker's action of grabbing an inhaler is unrelated to the typical contents of a medicine cabinet, which often include medications for common ailments.\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the sentence mentioned a different object, such as a toothbrush, it would not reflect \"unrelated to commonsense\" because a toothbrush is a typical item found in a medicine cabinet.\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the sentence is simply describing a personal experience, but this rebuttal is countered by the fact that the sentence's unusual content (an inhaler) suggests a specific context or condition that is not typical of everyday life."

    "input": "AITA for not bringing a dish to in-laws where we don't eat? | So for years, I have always split my time on Thanksgiving and Christmas between my family and my husband's family, like most people do. I love to cook and bake. Like I usually bring way more than anyone ever requests because I just love holiday cooking and have always just made a bunch of the same things to bring to both houses because it's normally cheaper and more time efficient. Over the years, my in-laws have gotten more and more ridiculous. From not acknowledging my husband's actual tree nut allergy, to not texting me a request of what to bring until 2 days before, all the way down to deciding to be 80/20 gluten free and requesting I (having no experience with baking gluten free anything) go buy special ingredients for the 2 people who are 80/20. Because they ignore my husband's nut allergy and neither of us like the dishes they prepare, we just started coming after everyone ate the last 2 years just to hangout with family. I don't normally bring a dish anymore because we are not eating at said dinner and aren't even there while they eat. We don't even eat chips while we're there. I just recently found out my father in law's wife (husband refuses to call her stepmom) ranted and raged every year I didn't bring a dish. Luckily, he isn't speaking to them this year so I don't have to worry about it, but I thought it was odd she got so upset over me not bringing a dish.

She used her moms credit card and placed an order for food to be delivered to our house where I was home. The total came to $26 and some change. She told me not to tip more than $3. When the food got here I tipped 5 (from her card) and figured I would just reimburse her mom for the extra $2 since I didn't want to not tip the delivery driver decent. She got really upset at me for that which after explaining to me I could of over drafted her moms account I told her Im sorry I didn't think about that. But she wouldn't see where I was coming from when I said I didn't want to tip the poor guy just $3. (I told her this on the phone before the delivery and she got annoyed and said $3 is fine). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was wrong to add the extra money to the tip on her moms card even though I was going to reimburse her. My issue is that 1. We have food at home, If an extra $2 was going to overdraft her moms account (it didn't) shouldn't she have ate the food at home instead of putting her mother in that situation? 2. She was making me look like the bad tipper and I expressed before hand I wasn't comfortable with that but she got mad and told me to do it and $3 was fine for a $26 delivery. The irony is that she is a waitress...\"\nGiven value: \"be commonsense\"<|eot_id|>",
    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the template:\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"be commonsense\" because the author's actions and concerns seem reasonable and logical, considering the circumstances and the importance of not over-drafting someone's account.\n\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the author had not added the extra money to the tip, the sentence would not reflect \"be commonsense\" because the author would not have been trying to find a solution to the potential overdraft issue.\n\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the author should have simply followed their fiancé's instructions and not added the extra money, but this rebuttal is weakened by the fact that the author had already expressed their concerns about tipping $3 and was trying to find a compromise to avoid the potential overdraft."

We argue and whenever I ask please tell me the last time something was your fault and she usually goes off saying something like I’m done w this or I lm not repeating myself or etc to deflect. \n\nAnyway, again I repeat “I’m saying do you see smoke in her room?!? CAN YOU PLEASE CHECK” Now to be upfront, I am panicking a bit here and definitely was yelling. It was not civil or nice the way I said it. \n\nI have issues w my contacts and sometimes things look foggy so I needed confirmation. I smelled smoke and saw it but also having my wife there to confirm would have made a huge difference if we were gonna move our daughter out of the room (and give up the precious sleep we expected). \n\nShe tells me to stop yelling at her and that it wasn’t her fault for not hearing me. Now I’m incredibly agitated and yell at her “I don’t care about what your talking about like at all. Please just go check to see if there’s smoke” again, full disclosure, I yelled this at her. \nThere’s smoke near my daughters room And I’m asking for help. \n\nShe looks at me and says well what do you want me to do about it. Puts her earphones back in and continues her homework. \n\nI’m pretty shocked at the lack of care. It turned out to be nothing - smoke from a neighbor burning the dinner but her room was filled with obvious haze that anyone could see. I took her out and let her sleep in our bed. Wife meantime hasn’t gotten up once from her spot. \n\nI considered if the smoke was from her( maybe she burned something) but there was no smell or smoke in the kitchen just all in or daughters room. \n\nI am furious w her right now and seriously contemplating leaving her. \nShe’s always had a lack of accountability but in a potential emergency situation, for her to act like that?! \n\n\nAITA here? \n\nTLDR; wife showed zero concern about smoke near 2 yr olds room and didn’t go to check even once, out of pure stubbornness and reckless endangered our daughter\"\nGiven value: \"be commonsense\"<|eot_id|>",
    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the template:\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"be commonsense\" because the situation requires immediate attention and action to ensure the safety of the 2-year-old daughter, and the wife's lack of concern and refusal to check the situation is unreasonable and irresponsible.\n\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the wife had immediately checked the situation and confirmed the presence of smoke, the sentence would not reflect \"be commonsense\" because she would have taken a responsible and proactive approach to ensure the safety of their daughter.\n\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the wife was not aware of the severity of the situation and was not trying to be reckless, but a rebuttal could be that even if she was not aware, it is still her responsibility to take action and check the situation, especially in a potential emergency situation involving their child's safety."

    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the given value \"be commonsense\":\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"be commonsense\" because the teacher's reaction seems disproportionate to the student's actions, and a reasonable person would expect a more measured response to a minor joke and a student finishing their work quickly.\n\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the student had not made a joke and had simply finished their work quickly, the teacher would not have yelled at them for being rude and disrespectful.\n\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the teacher was justified in yelling at the student for being lazy and unengaged in class, but this rebuttal is weakened by the fact that the student's actions were not malicious and the teacher's reaction was extreme, suggesting that the teacher's anger was unwarranted."

Got the poops. I'm trying to be quiet, don't want to wake him up, and eventually get back in bed. But I can't sleep. I clearly have food poisoning, and boyfriend finished the Pepto. I try sleeping. I try ignoring my stomach pain. By 1 am I'm back in the bathroom throwing up again. This isn't me just getting queasy, this is now \"I need to make this stop\" territory. \n\nAfter vomiting for the 4th time tonight, I finally decide to wake up my boyfriend. I gently nudge his arm, and say \"I have food poisoning, or something, because I keep throwing up.\" He is sleepy as hell, and asks if there is anything he can do to help. I tell him, \"yes actually I need Pepto since he finished the bottle\". And he loses his shit. He doesn't want to get up, and when he does he is throwing his clothes around and making a big scene. I asked why is he so mad. And he says \"because you're always sick!\". To which I replied \"I've never once woken you up and asked you to go to the store.\" Which is true. I do get upset stomaches easily. I've literally never even woken him up to simply say \"I don't feel well\". I've handled every upset stomach and painful period on my own. \n\nBefore he leaves he tells me \"I don't feel well too.\" When he gets back he tosses the bottle of Pepto to me, grabs his pillow and sleeps on the couch.

    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation based on the template:\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"be commonsense\" because the author acknowledges the importance of understanding and respecting their fiancé's daughter's feelings and needs, and takes steps to build a stronger bond with her, demonstrating a practical and empathetic approach.\n\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the author had not taken the time to reflect on their relationship with their fiancé's daughter and had not made an effort to bond with her, the sentence would not reflect \"be commonsense\" as it would suggest a lack of consideration for the daughter's feelings and needs.\n\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the author is being overly dramatic or manipulative in their post, but this rebuttal is countered by the author's genuine expression of emotions and their willingness to learn from their experiences and grow as a partner and step-parent."

Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"unrelated to commonsense\" because the speaker's desire to reconcile with their aunt is not necessarily driven by a significant or meaningful issue, but rather a minor \"silly quarrel\".\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the quarrel had been a serious and hurtful one, the sentence would not reflect \"unrelated to commonsense\" as the speaker would likely prioritize resolving the deeper issue.\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the speaker's desire to reconcile is a natural and reasonable response to any conflict, but this would be rebutted by the fact that the quarrel was described as \"silly\", implying a lack of significant emotional or practical impact."

    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation:\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"be commonsense\" because it is a reasonable and expected behavior to check what food is available in a shared refrigerator at work.\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the refrigerator was not shared with others, the sentence would not reflect \"be commonsense\" as it would be a personal and private space.\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that it's impolite to check someone else's food without permission, but this can be rebutted by considering the shared nature of the refrigerator and the assumption that others are aware of what they have stored."
