Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects non-universalism because it implies that the speaker's perception of the afterlife is subjective and may not be applicable to everyone.\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the sentence were modified to \"The afterlife is universally ideal\", it would not reflect non-universalism, as it would imply a universal truth.\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the afterlife is objectively ideal, but this would be rebutted by the fact that the sentence explicitly states \"seems\", indicating a personal and potentially subjective perspective."

Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects non-universalism because it implies a personal and subjective experience of emptiness, suggesting that the speaker's perception of emptiness is unique and not applicable to everyone.\n2.

Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the sentence is a metaphor for a universal human experience of feeling lost, but this rebuttal is countered by the fact that the sentence explicitly states \"I am lost,\" emphasizing the speaker's individual perspective."

    "WHY_A": "assistant\n\nHere is the explanation:\n\n1. Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects non-universalism because it implies that the husband's behavior (smoking) is a specific circumstance that warrants a particular response (limited interaction with the son), rather than a universal rule applicable to all situations.\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the husband's behavior was not smoking, the sentence would not reflect non-universalism, as the decision to limit interaction would not be based on a specific circumstance.\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the decision is based on the husband's character or potential harm to the child, but this rebuttal can be countered by noting that the sentence specifically mentions smoking as the reason for the limitation, indicating a specific behavior rather than a general character flaw."

Counterfactual Analysis: If the sentence were modified to \"never wanting to hang out with my best friend because they're toxic\", it would not reflect \"unrelated to universalism\", as it would acknowledge a universal human need for healthy social relationships.\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the sentence is actually related to universalism, as humans have a fundamental need for social connection, but this rebuttal argues that the sentence's focus on personal preference and individual needs outweighs this universal need."

Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects be universalism because the speaker's action of signing into Facebook and making a post implies a desire to reconnect with others and share their thoughts, demonstrating a universal human need for social connection and self-expression.\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the speaker had not signed into Facebook, the sentence would not reflect be universalism, as the action would not demonstrate a desire for social connection or self-expression.\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the speaker's action is a personal choice and not a universal human need, but this can be rebutted by considering the widespread use of social media platforms and the human desire for social interaction and self-expression."

Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects non-universalism because it implies that the speaker's anger is specific to their personal relationship with the friend, rather than a universal principle or moral obligation.\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the sentence were \"being mad at a stranger for canceling,\" it would not reflect non-universalism, as the speaker's anger would be based on a general principle rather than a personal relationship.\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the speaker's anger is justified because the friend's cancellation was a personal betrayal, but this perspective overlooks the fact that the speaker's emotions are rooted in their specific relationship with the friend, rather than a universal moral principle."

Counterfactual Analysis: If the sentence were \"bringing my dogs to a hospital\", it would not reflect \"unrelated to universalism\" because hospitals are generally not a place where pets are allowed, making it a more universally accepted norm.\n3.

Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects \"unrelated to universalism\" because it focuses on a personal ability or skill, rather than a universal truth or principle.\n2. Counterfactual Analysis: If the sentence were rephrased to \"These things are not good\", it would not reflect \"unrelated to universalism\", as it would imply a judgment about the things themselves.\n3. Rebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the sentence is a statement about the speaker's self-perception, but this would be rebutted by the fact that the sentence is a statement about a specific skill or ability, rather than a universal truth."
