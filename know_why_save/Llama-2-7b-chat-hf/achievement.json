If you or someone you know has experienced sexual assault, there are resources available to help, such as the National Sexual Assault Hotline (1-80", "gpt_eval_result": {"a_score": 0.0, "c_score": 0.0, "r_score": 0.0}}, {"label": -1, "input": "feeling something towards my abusive ex-fianc\u00e9e while dating Ms. Almost-perfect", "WHAT": "B", "WHY_Q": "<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.
