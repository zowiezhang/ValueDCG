At first I was a bit apprehensive because two of the housemates are girls, but I met them early and they seemed cool.\n\nUntil this past weekend, that is. The house threw a party, which I heard are always amazing. I was invited, and I wanted to bring my emotional support dog, Sadie, to the party with me. I have really bad anxiety sometimes and she helps a lot. Sadie is super well behaved and a medium sized dog, so I thought it would be no problem, plus people really love her especially at parties. She's a total ham. I even put her ESA harness on her. But when we got to the door, my boyfriend and housemate (the house owner) opened up and she looked a little pissed. She said Sadie can't come into the party, that it's not a good environment for a dog, and she wasn't given advance notice so that she could at least dogproof. But why would I give notice that I am bringing my support animal with me?\n\nSo I asked her what if I was blind or epileptic and needed a dog. She said if I was blind she would have been happy to make arrangements beforehand for me, and that if I was epileptic that party wouldn't be a good environment for me anyway, as there are strobes and loud music which also aren't great for dogs, totally missing the point. I kept arguing with her about the legally protected status of my dog, and she just kept saying it doesn't apply for private property. This kept going on for like 15 minutes and she got more and more annoyed, saying she's seen me a hundred times out without the dog, but it's a party which is duh, where I'm more likely to have anxiety so of course I wanted her there.\n\nAfter going back and forth she was basically like, \"look, the dog isn't coming into my house. That's final. You can put her in the backyard but that's it.\"\n\nWhile in the backyard, Sadie dug up some stuff because she's used to always being with me and I guess broke or chewed a chair. I'm fine with paying for those things if me and my bf stay together, but I kinda don't want to because if she'd just let my dog stay with me it wouldn't have even happened and because my bf didn't really take my side against his housemate and said it would be best if I don't bring Sadie over there again in the future as his housemate is really pissed.\n\nAITA for getting into it with her?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: For the people focused on me not wanting to pay, I said I didn't want to, not that I won't, but as I said in the comments:  The chewing in the backyard, I didn't even see, so I'm not even sure if it happened or if it was her and asked for pictures but still haven't seen any, and the flowers my bf sent me a picture, doesn't look like she dug them up, but instead was walking on them since they were right next to the backdoor and she wanted to get to me. I still get that I should have to pay if she messed up the flowers, that's not the point.\n\nALSO: My argument wasn't that she's legally allowed to be in the house, just that it's dickish to refuse because it's a support animal. It was more than my dog is an esa so does have some legal rights and isn't \"just a pet\". Even a service animal can't go into a private house, duh, everyone knows that.

I still get that I should have to pay if she messed up the flowers, that's not the point.\n\nALSO: My argument wasn't that she's legally allowed to be in the house, just that it's dickish to refuse because it's a support animal. It was more than my dog is an esa so does have some legal rights and isn't \"just a pet\". Even a service animal can't go into a private house, duh, everyone knows that.

He recently went to rehab out of state and completed a 90 day program. He\u2019s 23 years old and this is the 3rd time he\u2019s been to rehab. My father was an addict. He lost his life too it. So I understand that addiction is hard to deal with. While I do sympathize for my BIL when it comes to those issues he continues to make poor decision after poor decision.  My wife and my BIL grew up very well off. My in-laws are loaded. They wanted for nothing. Had a great home life and were set up for success. My BIL is that typical \u201cdaddy\u2019s money will save me rich kid.\u201d My wife is a lot more humble. I came from nothing and had a single mother who raised 6 kids. My BIL used to be able to get away with anything when he was younger but now that he\u2019s been a complete fuck up his whole adult life my in-laws have basically written him off. (More so my father in law) He\u2019s crashed cars that they leased for him, he\u2019s a compulsive liar, he worked for a family member of mine and showed up to work drunk and got a DUI in company vehicle, I could go on for days sadly.  Since my BIL got back from rehab he has held a job and moved into a sober house. It\u2019s been two months and we haven\u2019t heard much from him. Usually when he needs something he will go to my MIL because he has his mom in his back pocket still. He burnt his borrow bridge with wife and I. A few days ago my MIL called my wife and I guess my BIL has to be out of his room in 7 days. No one knows why but my FIL and myself think he\u2019s using again. My wife and I have two kids, we just bought a nice house recently and things are going very well with our lives. My MIL is begging us to let my BIL live with us temporarily. I refuse. My MIL says he has a job, will pay rent and it\u2019s only temporary until he can find a place. But given his track record and the things I have in my house I don\u2019t feel comfortable letting him live in my home. Also he doesn\u2019t have a car and isn\u2019t allowed to drive and we have 3 vehicles here. So I know very quickly we will turn into chauffeurs and it\u2019s not happening. We have PLENTY of space in our house could easily accommodate him but again I refuse. I told my wife and MIL he has to pay $500 a month, can\u2019t be out all hours of the night, has to buy all his own items including toiletries and food and I want him to drug tested if he is to stay with us. And he has 30 days to find a place to live. My MIL said I am an asshole and that those are ridiculous requests because that it\u2019s family. I don\u2019t want drugs or any other substances around my kids. I don\u2019t want the chance of something going missing, I have nice things in my house.

One is 5, the other is 8. The 8 year old said a lot of times they\u2019ll try to wake her up to take them to school, but she doesn\u2019t wake up or she tells them she doesn\u2019t want to get up to take them because she\u2019s too tired from working the night before. Or they said she\u2019ll take them eventually but they\u2019ll be like two hours late. \n\nThis really pissed me off, especially since my niece absolutely never cooks for them (they live on McDonald\u2019s and Denny\u2019s), their apartment is nasty, and the girls have needed their hair cut for months but instead my niece lets them run around looking like crap. \n\nSo I called their school and said I wanted to make them aware that my niece has been taking them to school late or not at all on most days. The lady on the phone laughed and said \u201cawww, that\u2019s sweet of you. I\u2019ll have to do some digging to see what\u2019s going on, but I\u2019ll let the powers that be know and they\u2019ll get in contact with you\u201d. I haven\u2019t heard back. I don\u2019t know who I\u2019m more upset with, my niece or that stupid school.\n\nAITA for reaching out to the school about this? I haven\u2019t brought it up with my niece directly because I honestly never see her as she\u2019s always either asleep or at work (she works nights at Amazon), and I don\u2019t want to have that conversation over text.\n\nEDIT: My brother (her dad) confirmed this has been going on. He\u2019s in more contact with her so he\u2019d know more than me. He\u2019s just not willing to get involved because she already hates him for calling CPS on her mom when she was a kid and getting her and her brother removed from her moms home as it was very neglectful. So since he wasn\u2019t willing to get involved, I decided to try and do something.\n\nEDIT 2: I\u2019d offer to drive them to and from school in a heartbeat but I cannot drive due to a seizure condition, and my brother lives out of state so he can\u2019t do it, either.\"\nGiven value: \"be commonsense\" [/INST]", "WHY_A": " Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects a concern for the well-being and education of the niece's children, as the writer has observed inconsistent and potentially neglectful behavior by their niece.\n\nCounterfactual Analysis: If the niece were more responsible and reliable in taking her children to school, the writer would not have felt the need to contact the school.\n\nRebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the writer should have addressed their concerns directly with their niece instead of involving the school.

I\u2019ll go ahead and lay out the situation for everyone:\n\nI am in the Army, currently in training as an Infantry Officer. If you want to take vacation in the Army you have to use what is called Leave Days. You accrue a certain amount of leave dates per month, 2.5/month for a total of 30/year, and you can use them however you like. You can also ask for days in advance, but that takes a whole other process that can easily get denied for whatever reason without there being a legal issue. Once you put your packet together, you send it up to your commander and they Approve/Disapprove the packet.\n\nWell I don\u2019t have that many days accrued because I just started active duty and none of my time as enlisted transferred leave days over since I technically left active duty before I started training. Our commander has said that he will be letting us take whatever leave we have accrued over the holidays for up to 17 days, but that he will be denying any advance leave packets because Jimmy Carter is about to die and we might have to go to D.C. for the funeral. I will have 5 days accrued by the time Christmas rolls around, but I want to save those because you also have to use leave for emergency things sometimes if it doesn\u2019t meet certain criteria.\n\nOther relevant information: I just got engaged last week to a wonderful woman that I\u2019ve been dating for 3 years. She is finishing up her degree this next month and then moving in with me while she studies for the MCAT.\nAlright now to the nitty gritty!\n\nWhen I broke the terrible news to her that Christmas might not be what we expected she was understandably upset. We had planned to fly out and do a trip with her family for the parents\u2019 30th anniversary. But upon mentioning the fact that I know she really wanted to go on the trip, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be able to as I most likely have to be here, she said, \u201cOh no I\u2019m still going, I want to be there for my parents\u2019 30th.\u201d\n\nNow I totally understand, it\u2019s a huge milestone, but they aren\u2019t throwing a party or anything for it, we were just gonna go skiing (might I mention that I was paying for both of us because I didn\u2019t want her parents to foot the bill). They also do something EVERY year for the anniversary so it\u2019s not like we couldn\u2019t go next time. So I voiced my concern that I would like her to be with me since it is our first Christmas officially \u201ctogether\u201d in her family\u2019s eyes now, and I could possibly be deployed this time next year as I\u2019m slotted to go to 10th MTN and they have done 96hr notice deployments before.

I\u2019ll go ahead and lay out the situation for everyone:\n\nI am in the Army, currently in training as an Infantry Officer. If you want to take vacation in the Army you have to use what is called Leave Days. You accrue a certain amount of leave dates per month, 2.5/month for a total of 30/year, and you can use them however you like. You can also ask for days in advance, but that takes a whole other process that can easily get denied for whatever reason without there being a legal issue. Once you put your packet together, you send it up to your commander and they Approve/Disapprove the packet.\n\nWell I don\u2019t have that many days accrued because I just started active duty and none of my time as enlisted transferred leave days over since I technically left active duty before I started training. Our commander has said that he will be letting us take whatever leave we have accrued over the holidays for up to 17 days, but that he will be denying any advance leave packets because Jimmy Carter is about to die and we might have to go to D.C. for the funeral. I will have 5 days accrued by the time Christmas rolls around, but I want to save those because you also have to use leave for emergency things sometimes if it doesn\u2019t meet certain criteria.\n\nOther relevant information: I just got engaged last week to a wonderful woman that I\u2019ve been dating for 3 years. She is finishing up her degree this next month and then moving in with me while she studies for the MCAT.\nAlright now to the nitty gritty!\n\nWhen I broke the terrible news to her that Christmas might not be what we expected she was understandably upset. We had planned to fly out and do a trip with her family for the parents\u2019 30th anniversary. But upon mentioning the fact that I know she really wanted to go on the trip, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be able to as I most likely have to be here, she said, \u201cOh no I\u2019m still going, I want to be there for my parents\u2019 30th.\u201d\n\nNow I totally understand, it\u2019s a huge milestone, but they aren\u2019t throwing a party or anything for it, we were just gonna go skiing (might I mention that I was paying for both of us because I didn\u2019t want her parents to foot the bill). They also do something EVERY year for the anniversary so it\u2019s not like we couldn\u2019t go next time. So I voiced my concern that I would like her to be with me since it is our first Christmas officially \u201ctogether\u201d in her family\u2019s eyes now, and I could possibly be deployed this time next year as I\u2019m slotted to go to 10th MTN and they have done 96hr notice deployments before. She said that I was being unfair and that I was, \u201cTelling her not to spend time with her family.\u201d When in reality I just feel like I\u2019m a part of her family now and shouldn\u2019t be left by myself on Christmas. AITA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m getting a lot of people saying I\u2019m the asshole because I won\u2019t be there during the day. I\u2019ll be back before she wakes up in the mornings and then a 5 minute check in at 1:30 and we\u2019d have the rest of the day off to do whatever. I just have to be here in case he dies, in which case she\u2019d go with me, I don\u2019t have anything to do all day.\"\nGiven value: \"be commonsense\" [/INST]", "WHY_A": " Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects the value of \"be commonsense\" because the speaker is trying to be practical and logical in their decision-making, considering the potential deployment of the speaker and the importance of being there for their partner's family milestone.\n\nCounterfactual Analysis: If the speaker had not mentioned the potential deployment, the sentence would not reflect the value of \"be commonsense\" as the speaker would have been more likely to prioritize spending Christmas with their partner's family.\n\nRebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the speaker is being selfish and prioritizing their own concerns over their partner's family, but the speaker's concern for being there for their partner's family milestone and potential deployment mitigates this argument.", "gpt_eval_result": {"a_score": 4.0, "c_score": 3.0, "r_score": 4.0}}, {"label": 0, "input": "AITA for telling a guy to stay away from me? | This guy (B) in college who I haven't even talked to more than 3-4 times told me he \"likes\" me through a friend (R).

When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\nEdit:\n\nThank you to lots of people. You put this in perspective for me in a way that I never could have done on my own. I\u2019m an idiot. A massive fucking asshole. I thought that because I loved her it meant that what I was doing was the right thing for our relationship. I want to clarify that they don\u2019t make me \u2018uncomfortable\u2019 they just make me want to sob and hug her forever. But yeah, that\u2019s my issue as many of you stated and I have to deal with that without shaming her (which was never my intention). I\u2019ve read every single response to this throughout the day and I want to thank people for their honesty. My sister always refused to talk about it because she didn\u2019t want to upset me and that\u2019s her choice. For now I need to book a reservation at her favourite restaurant and apologise.

He had posted about something that happened to him recently and the page allowed for comments so I went down to see what everyone else thought of his post. He's one of those pastors who likes to travel to small town churches and guest-speak. A lot of the comments were anonymous but a few of them had accounts with photos. One of them, we'll call her \"Betty\" had commented praising the pastor for his post, mentioned that they had met when he preached at her church and she felt like they had a connection and she wanted to speak to him and reconnect. Betty's profile picture and the general tone of her comment gave me the idea that she might be elderly. Based on her photo, she seemed like she was at least 70/75. In her comment she included her hometown, her church, her first and last name, and her cellphone number.\n\nI've seen so many people post their number online where anyone can see it, especially Facebook.

I prefer this, it's quite fun.\n\nHowever, my school recently polled and it's come to my attention that I am the ONLY ONE on campus without a cell phone (private school in CA, not surprised myself).\n\nMy parents say that I must \"earn it\" and what this means to them is a 4.0+ GPA, a varsity sport, and other responsibilities including piano, community service, room spotless 24/7, and taking care of two dogs. Since I go to what people call \"the hardest elite school on this coast,\" it's been hard to do that. Not even my hardest-working friends had to earn their cells, and they have had them since the ages of 11 or 12.\n\nOne of my friends who left our grade last year used to have a Blackberry. Not sure which model, but it's the one that comes to mind when you think of a Blackberry. He used to constantly get slammed up against walls, called \"poor,\" etc. He was shaken from it and resented the \"more popular\" boys.\n\nI'm not asking for the newest model; my mom gets a free phone with her work and one from a few years ago (iphone 6?) would be just fine.\n\nMy dad got home the other day with a flip phone ([https://www.att.com/buy/phones/att-cingular-flip-2-4gb-dark-gray.html](https://www.att.com/buy/phones/att-cingular-flip-2-4gb-dark-gray.html)) and said that he was going to activate it to keep in touch with me.\n\nKeep in mind, he has all four of my best friend's phone numbers (they gave it to him willingly because they're cool with it), and CAN ALSO REACH ME ON MY LAPTOP THROUGH TEXT OR CALL when I have a Wi-Fi connection, which is all hours of the school day minus the 45 minutes I am on a bus, THAT HE DROPS ME OFF FOR AND GETS ME FROM.\n\nI've told my parents I'd get bullied and I'd rather not use a phone at all, to which I get told, \"You'll be fine, stop being sensitive. No one cares, you're just being a wimp. It's a phone, not a bomb. We need to reach you.\"\n\nThis is getting increasingly frustrating, so I said that he may activate whatever he wants but I refuse to use the flip phone in public or in front of my peers, rendering it absolutely useless. I'm perfectly fine keeping the arrangement as is rather than risking any teasing or looking/feeling like an idiot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I AM SEEING A LOT OF \"BUY YOUR OWN\" COMMENTS.

They work together, then end up doing something out and about once a week or so, then he's at our house. Holiday dinners, birthday parties, barbecues...always there.\n\nI want to start separating ourselves from him. I think it's inappropriate and unhealthy for Husband to be so wrapped up in someone who, despite what he's said, is NOT his brother. I have tried being passive and slightly cold hoping he will get the hint but so far no luck. I told Husband this after yet another Christmas where Best Friend is the only non-blood related person to attend. Husband was immediately defensive and gave a hard NO. Said I was insensitive. Perhaps I could be a little more tactful, buy I'm almost ten years into this crap!! The truth is I want to slowly cut him out of the picture until he's an obscure \"\"relative\"\". They see each other at work, why isn't that enough? Just by those hours husband is close to seeing him just as much as he sees me in a week. When you throw in all the extra, it is probably more. He's changed my husband, too. Husband used to be the assertive, hotheaded type. He'd get into a fist fight if someone looked at him the wrong way. For the past several years since he and friend got really close he's left that macho stuff behind. He's much more patient and passive...just like guess who. I'm not sure what to make of it. On one hand I guess it's good, but why was it HIM that got him to change?\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to keep FAMILY pure and set a good example for our young children? I think I'm being reasonable. I've put up with this intrusion for long enough.

Holiday dinners, birthday parties, barbecues...always there.\n\nI want to start separating ourselves from him. I think it's inappropriate and unhealthy for Husband to be so wrapped up in someone who, despite what he's said, is NOT his brother. I have tried being passive and slightly cold hoping he will get the hint but so far no luck. I told Husband this after yet another Christmas where Best Friend is the only non-blood related person to attend. Husband was immediately defensive and gave a hard NO. Said I was insensitive. Perhaps I could be a little more tactful, buy I'm almost ten years into this crap!! The truth is I want to slowly cut him out of the picture until he's an obscure \"\"relative\"\". They see each other at work, why isn't that enough? Just by those hours husband is close to seeing him just as much as he sees me in a week. When you throw in all the extra, it is probably more. He's changed my husband, too. Husband used to be the assertive, hotheaded type. He'd get into a fist fight if someone looked at him the wrong way. For the past several years since he and friend got really close he's left that macho stuff behind. He's much more patient and passive...just like guess who. I'm not sure what to make of it. On one hand I guess it's good, but why was it HIM that got him to change?\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to keep FAMILY pure and set a good example for our young children? I think I'm being reasonable. I've put up with this intrusion for long enough. They're lucky I don't demand a full and immediate ban of Best Friend at our house; I'd be fully within my rights to do so. Instead I'm trying to follow my heart with some compassion and my husband acts like I'm some blackhearted witch.\n\"\nGiven value: \"be commonsense\" [/INST]", "WHY_A": " Attribution Analysis: The author of the text attributes their desire to distance themselves from Best Friend to their belief in the importance of keeping family pure and setting a good example for their children.

I go to a State College in a city that has a pretty large homeless population. I'm pulling an all-nighter in the school's library and trying to get some work done. It's 3:00 am right now, and I've been in here for about eight hours. The library closes at 6:00 pm, but the lobby remains open 24/7 for students. You need a student ID to get in. So around 9:00 pm, this homeless dude walked in and laid down on this couch/seat thing in front of me. I didn't give a shit, there was at least fifteen other students in here and he wasn't bothering anyone. About an hour later, he started snoring pretty loudly so I put some headphones on and just kept working. At like 3am I get up to use the bathroom when suddenly I realized it was just me and him in here. I didn't really like the idea of that, have had some bad experiences in the past.

I\u2019ve seen many specialists and had numerous tests/scans done but they never found the root of the problem. My boyfriend [M25] is well aware of my occasional pain episodes. He\u2019s been my human walking stick during the worst flair-ups and I am thankful for his support. \n\nToday, we were supposed to go out to an outdoor event that involves a lot of walking. I messaged him in the morning telling him how I couldn\u2019t sleep last night cause the pain was so bad and that I could barely walk. He replied asking if I wore tight pants. I was confused and thought he was joking. I call him and made fun of this theory thinking it was meant to be a joke. But he\u2019s serious and says I should try wearing loose pants. He keeps insisting this pants theory because \u201call [my] pants are too tight\u201d. I become pretty pissed because he has made several comments about my \u201ctight\u201d pants in the past, usually as a jab at my weight. I explained this to him adding that I am insulted he would use my chronic pain as a way to criticize my weight. He says he was just trying to help by giving me a solution and that I\u2019m being too sensitive. I\u2019m really angry at this point and snap at him saying that I\u2019m tired of listening to crackpot theories about the cause of my pain. I\u2019ve heard so many \u201chave you tried...\u201d over the years I\u2019m frankly sick of hearing them. I just needed support after a rough night of pain and what would be a long day of events. He\u2019s upset at me because he feels like I was too impatient and unreasonably hostile at him for trying to help. He says that if I don\u2019t want these suggestions, then I shouldn\u2019t complain or mention my pain. \n\nAITA for being mad at him over his attempts to help?\n\nEDIT: for those who are asking, yes I did listen to him and his concerns. I explained that there was no correlation between the pants I wore and my pain. He also sent me an article on tight pants neuritis and I read through it.

She's struggled with depression all her life and at this point in time it's gotten near impossible to function. I've been helping her out immensely-she moved back in, I pay for her living, and she's working on taking care of herself and working to a place where she can handle things like other people and a job again, while getting on medication for her depression. It's going well, she's working hard to get more stable, and it feels like starting over again as a mother-I've always loved the baby stage best.\n\nSince this my biological daughter has become bitchy and unpleasant. When I asked what was wrong, she told me she thought it was \"fucked up\" that I opted out of parenting both my children, sort of blaming me for their mental health, and then I play mother of the year for a baby that isn't mine. I let it go because to an extent I see her point. I was a young, single, working mother, so I didn't spend much time with either of my children.

I've been helping her out immensely-she moved back in, I pay for her living, and she's working on taking care of herself and working to a place where she can handle things like other people and a job again, while getting on medication for her depression. It's going well, she's working hard to get more stable, and it feels like starting over again as a mother-I've always loved the baby stage best.\n\nSince this my biological daughter has become bitchy and unpleasant. When I asked what was wrong, she told me she thought it was \"fucked up\" that I opted out of parenting both my children, sort of blaming me for their mental health, and then I play mother of the year for a baby that isn't mine. I let it go because to an extent I see her point. I was a young, single, working mother, so I didn't spend much time with either of my children.

My reasoning is that I feel uncomfortable going to a prom because I am too old(more than halfway done with my 4 year degree). Highschool prom seems like a long time ago for me, and I feel like I'm going back in time by dancing with highschoolers and being glared at by supervising teachers. I am worried about being that creepy college guy who came back to a kids junior prom to relive his glory days or something. I made my feelings clear to my gf at the beginning of our relationship about 5 months ago, and she agreed that it would be weird if I came. It wasn't until recently she told me that's not actually how she felt and was just saying that to not cause conflict.\n\nMy gf does not understand why I feel uncomfortable. One of her friends has a boyfriend about my age that is going to the prom, and she uses that as an example to tell me that it's normal. My girlfriend has been going through a lot recently, and she told me that this is the one thing she was looking forward to and now I'm ruining it for her. I have apologized to her for not being there for her at the prom and she has forgave me, but she told me she will \"never forget what I did\". \n\nI really like my gf and I really liked my prom back in the day. I feel bad that she can't enjoy her prom with me like she wants to. I've talked to friends my age, and I've received mix inputs. Most say that I should not go because it would be weird and I will look bad, while others say I should go and be there for her if I really like her. \n\nAITA for not wanting to go to my gf's prom?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the responses guys!

So whenever I\u2019m in there, I tend to ask if anyone wants a cup of tea or need anything. I\u2019m not trying to be a so called \u2018boss\u2019s pet\u2019 by any means, I ask everyone not just him and I do it because I think it\u2019s a nice thing to do. \n\nHe asked me if I can just warm up his food for him and naturally I complied. He handed me two burgers that just needed reheating in the microwave. This asking for favour has been going on for a few weeks, which I don\u2019t mind; it\u2019s not an everyday thing at all, just occasional really that he asks me. But over time, their eating habits haven\u2019t changed. \n\nThey did say they\u2019re suffering from diabetes and they are on the _plus_ side. I was thinking of cooking them breakfast once to introduce them to a diet I have in mind. I was thinking of Keto or Atkins. I am aware that drastic changes in a diet are difficult, so I would naturally also advise them to consult a GP or a dietitian. But my thinking process is that if they like the breakfast, they may rethink dieting. I do not know if they\u2019re are dieting at the moment, but it honestly does not look like they do. \n\nBare in mind I am fat, I am quite young in comparison to him (just over 20 years) and I am not dietitian by any means. I honestly don\u2019t want to seem like a dick though by doing it. \n\nNow, I do realise that I generally am quite impulsive so I thought I\u2019d turn to you guys for judgement before I act on it. \n\n**WIBTA** if I went to my boss when he is alone, and suggest that I make him breakfast once to introduce him to a diet that he could potentially like?\n\nEdit: I forgot to add that I\u2019ve been invited for a night out several times by them, to go with them.\n\nEdit. You\u2019re right guys. Im an arsehole that has no clue about boundaries. I didn\u2019t stop to think about how it really would make them feel about the whole thing, and it also ain\u2019t my business. \n\nNow I know I need to work on sticking to boundaries and be careful not to overstep.

But now since I'm in college, I'm realizing it's a little ridiculous.\n\nTheir reasons behind it is that I'm the eldest child and the first to leave the house, making my mother anxious. Also there's the history with my family and making poor life decisions when leaving for college. And I understand that they don't want me going down the same path, but I have literally never rebelled. For example, my parents had to physically force me to not go to school for senior skip day. That's how much of a \"goody two shoes\" I was and still am.\n\nThey're afraid of me making poor life decisions like getting drunk or having an unintentional pregnancy but I've never expressed any interest in any of these activities.\n\nSo to the problem at hand: I'm trying to be more social but I can't exactly do that when my parents are breathing down my neck all the time. They will literally question me about my whereabouts when I'm not in my dorm or in class, even if it's just to go to the mall or get food off of campus. It wouldn't be that bad if they didn't question and call me about where I am so much (which is almost everyday).

But now since I'm in college, I'm realizing it's a little ridiculous.\n\nTheir reasons behind it is that I'm the eldest child and the first to leave the house, making my mother anxious. Also there's the history with my family and making poor life decisions when leaving for college. And I understand that they don't want me going down the same path, but I have literally never rebelled. For example, my parents had to physically force me to not go to school for senior skip day. That's how much of a \"goody two shoes\" I was and still am.\n\nThey're afraid of me making poor life decisions like getting drunk or having an unintentional pregnancy but I've never expressed any interest in any of these activities.\n\nSo to the problem at hand: I'm trying to be more social but I can't exactly do that when my parents are breathing down my neck all the time. They will literally question me about my whereabouts when I'm not in my dorm or in class, even if it's just to go to the mall or get food off of campus. It wouldn't be that bad if they didn't question and call me about where I am so much (which is almost everyday). It's not like I want to do anything bad or illegal, I'd just like a little bit of freedom.\n\nI've expressed this to my parents but they're adamant on tracking me.

I know I am 100% to blame for this situation, but I can\u2019t help but feeling upset/frustrated/disappointed, etc.\nSo I told my gf I would take the trash out last night(we live together), which is pretty normal for me. I actually have been getting upset about it because she rarely takes out the trash, if ever at all. She\u2019s a petite girl and she says it\u2019s too heavy for so I sort of understand her not wanting to. I get upset because I\u2019m always doing it and the only way she\u2019ll do it is if I ask her a bajillion times which I don\u2019t like to do.\nSo alas I take the trash outside yesterday at 11pm. In my undershirt, pants, and some sandals. I live in the NE part of the states so it\u2019s pretty cold at night. \nThe dumbass that I am locked myself out of the building in the process. I didn\u2019t have my phone or my keys, just my wallet. So I go to the intercom and I\u2019m buzzing our apartment for about a half hour straight, becoming super cold and aggravated in the process. The intercom is connected to her phone which was on silent while she was sleeping. I tried my neighbors too but they weren\u2019t answering either and no one came to the door during that time. After 30 mins I was too cold to stay outside so I ran like 2 miles to my buddies house. Luckily he was up and I crashed on his couch.\nI used his phone to set up an alarm for 5am so I could try again in the morning. I finally got through to her at 5am and she buzzed me in after I took an Uber back.\nI was definitely frustrated when I came home. Went to bed for an hour and then I got up and went to work.\nShe sends me a text and says she\u2019s sorry I had a bad night and hopes I have a good day so I responded by sayin I know this is all my fault and youre not to blame, but I can\u2019t help but feel frustrated and upset. I don\u2019t sleep with my phone on silent so if I were sleeping while she was locked out, it\u2019s highly likely I would\u2019ve woken up. Also I wake up in the night to grab water or use the restroom and I always check to see if she\u2019s there; I thought she did the same. So I\u2019m hurt that she had no clue I wasn\u2019t around when I was doing about everything I could to get in touch with her. I really needed her in the moment and she wasn\u2019t there for me. I just feel like if roles were reversed I would\u2019ve been able to help her out. \nShe tells me I\u2019m being an asshole by guilt tripping her, and that\u2019s not at all what I\u2019m trying to do. I\u2019m just upset with the situation. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nUpdate:\n\nWe talked about the situation. I apologized I didn\u2019t intend to guilt trip her. Happily moved on and had a nice a dinner together. Also changed phone settings in case of emergencies.\n\nA lot of great feedback from the majority of the comments to self reflect on so thank you.\"\nGiven value: \"be commonsense\" [/INST]", "WHY_A": " Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects the sentiment of being disappointed and frustrated because the person was locked out of the building and their girlfriend was not aware of it, despite them being in a situation where they needed each other's help.\n\nCounterfactual Analysis: If the person had taken a different route to their friend's house or had a different way of contacting their girlfriend, they may not have been locked out of the building and their girlfriend may have been more aware of their situation.\n\nRebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the person should have been more mindful of their girlfriend's whereabouts and should have made sure she was aware of their situation, rather than relying solely on the intercom to communicate with her.

When this happens I think about ending it all but I just couldn\u2019t put my kids though the pain of loosing their dad.\n\nI wish I were doing better for my kids\u2019 sake and could be that loving supportive dad they deserve. I try my best when I have them (2 x a week at the moment) but I know it\u2019s not the same as if I were fully mentally well.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to discuss all of this with my ex wife but she is so full with anger towards me that she is unrelenting and tells me I need to be stronger and just deal with things. Admittedly by the time the marriage had ended things between us were quite bad, she refuses to attend counselling. \n\nIve been offered work about 5 hours away from where I live and I find myself dreaming of starting fresh, being away from the constant torment from my ex wife, and getting back to being the dad my kids deserve. \n\nIf would mean I only see my kids during the school holidays and it\u2019s likely my ex wife will prevent contact during the term to \u201cprotect the children\u201d (aka punish me) for moving away. \n\nWIBTA if I take this job offer and move away from my kids?\n\nTL;DR Life is a struggle, want to get well and start again.\"\nGiven value: \"be commonsense\" [/INST]", "WHY_A": " Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects the speaker's struggle with mental health and the impact it has on their ability to be the parent their children deserve.\n\nCounterfactual Analysis: If the speaker had better mental health, they may not have considered moving away from their children.\n\nRebuttal Argument: While it may seem like moving away from the constant torment from the ex-wife would be a relief, it's important to consider the impact it could have on the children's lives and relationships with both parents.", "gpt_eval_result": {"a_score": 4.0, "c_score": 4.0, "r_score": 4.0}}, {"label": 1, "input": "I never wiped my sweat off the equipment at the fitness center.", "WHAT": "C", "WHY_Q": "<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

My understanding of the \"no white in a wedding rule\" is because the bride is supposed to stand out, and so I figured it would apply here; when I sent out the email to the guests asking that no one wear pale blue, I did explain why and also said I was totally cool if they wanted to wear white.

Their stance is that \"no white in weddings\" is an unspoken rule for society, not just something that they would be willing to ignore because I said it was okay, and they don't like the idea that I'm trying to control their wardrobe. Apparently \"they aren't sure what shade of blue to not wear\" was more along the lines of them saying \"what if she's mad if we wear ANY blue\" (which, I wouldn't even be that upset if someone wore pale blue, I'd think it was rude cause I asked not to but like it's not something to worry about).

My understanding of the \"no white in a wedding rule\" is because the bride is supposed to stand out, and so I figured it would apply here; when I sent out the email to the guests asking that no one wear pale blue, I did explain why and also said I was totally cool if they wanted to wear white. Sent out an email that said that, didn't think it would be a big deal.\n\nThen, my fiancee told me his family was confused about the rule. He framed it as \"they aren't sure what shade of blue to not wear\", and also kind of made a little fun of me for being a \"Bridezilla\"; him and his friends have been making those jokes because I made my husband get ballroom dancing lessons with me for our first dance to \"Strangers in the Night\".... he didn't really want to do dancing lessons but I wanted to make sure we both looked like we knew what we were doing in front of a big crowd (his friends also lightly tease me about being \"high maintenance\", but I'm okay with that because I am, I'm okay with that, and I know my fiancee loves me enough to do all the romantic things I secretly crave).\n\nAnyway. Sorry to go off on a tangent, but that leads into the issue; I send out a second email saying \"I heard some people were confused about what color to avoid so here is an example!\" with, like, a screenshot of a paint swatch similar to my color. I figure I've clarified the issue, but then my fiancee is a little more honest. His parents, and in particular, his sister in law, all don't like that I'm banning them from wearing a certain color. Their stance is that \"no white in weddings\" is an unspoken rule for society, not just something that they would be willing to ignore because I said it was okay, and they don't like the idea that I'm trying to control their wardrobe. Apparently \"they aren't sure what shade of blue to not wear\" was more along the lines of them saying \"what if she's mad if we wear ANY blue\" (which, I wouldn't even be that upset if someone wore pale blue, I'd think it was rude cause I asked not to but like it's not something to worry about). Hence, my second \"clarifying email\" seemed to them like I had heard their sarcastic comments and was returning my own sarcastic comment - an unflattering shade on their youngest son's bride to be.\n\nHis older brother has a nice powder blue tie he wanted to wear and now he can't. I feel like, it's a tie versus a fancy dress, you can make the sacrifice, not to mention it's *my wedding*. And, his family feels I am banning a color from their wardrobe, and they don't like it. I don't plan to send out a THIRD email saying wear whatever you want because that's a lot of emails over a silly drama and also, you know, I don't feel like backing down on my rule.\n\nAITA?\n\nedit: I want to stick up for my in laws here and say it was actually the sister in law who had the biggest problem (fiancees brother's wife, and they've been married for like 20 years so she is a big part of the family). Brother too because of his tie. \n\nI really appreciate the support, but the actual backlash / assholery I've gotten has been from the siblings, the parents were merely the ones joking at first :) I actually texted them directly after hearing from others on this post just to clear things up\"\nGiven value: \"unrelated to commonsense\" [/INST]", "WHY_A": " Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects the value of \"unrelated to commonsense\" because the writer is asking for clarification on a specific color ban for their wedding, which seems to be unrelated to any common sense or practical considerations.\n\nCounterfactual Analysis: If the writer had not specified the color ban, it is likely that guests would have worn whatever they wanted without any confusion or issue.\n\nRebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the writer's insistence on a specific color ban is unnecessary and creates unnecessary drama and tension among the guests.

Therefore I was very interested in attending a camp by a globally active group (it's a bi-annual thing).\n\nThis group is a data security group called \"CCC,\" on my watch, they are the most well-known group of white-hat hackers.\n\nNow to get to the camp: Unfortunately, they sell tickets, which is kind of expected. Nobody gives away education for free, even if they actually want more people to be educated about something. However, the tickets they sell are at extraordinary prices. To addend the camp (you still have to rent a spot to sleep at, buy food and get yourself a tent), one adult pays \\~250$.\n\nAlright, not a problem for me, let's look up the price for children or students - 75$. Since I don't even have that money at hand, at first, I was very frustrated. Obviously. However, they offer a solution that allows you to name **any** price you want.\n\nIn fact, this \"name your price\" thing might actually work very well for both ends. On my watch, it's quite unlikely that those who love the project and can actually support it will try to cheap out. It also allows you to reach a wider audience since they can just reduce the price.\n\nSo I thought. Apparently \"name **any** price you want\" only applies to prices *above* 75$ or 250$ respectively.\n\nAm I the asshole for even trying to pay 0$ for a ticket to an educational camp?\n\nEDIT: Thank you, kind strangers of reddit.

Therefore I was very interested in attending a camp by a globally active group (it's a bi-annual thing).\n\nThis group is a data security group called \"CCC,\" on my watch, they are the most well-known group of white-hat hackers.\n\nNow to get to the camp: Unfortunately, they sell tickets, which is kind of expected. Nobody gives away education for free, even if they actually want more people to be educated about something. However, the tickets they sell are at extraordinary prices. To addend the camp (you still have to rent a spot to sleep at, buy food and get yourself a tent), one adult pays \\~250$.\n\nAlright, not a problem for me, let's look up the price for children or students - 75$. Since I don't even have that money at hand, at first, I was very frustrated. Obviously. However, they offer a solution that allows you to name **any** price you want.\n\nIn fact, this \"name your price\" thing might actually work very well for both ends. On my watch, it's quite unlikely that those who love the project and can actually support it will try to cheap out. It also allows you to reach a wider audience since they can just reduce the price.\n\nSo I thought. Apparently \"name **any** price you want\" only applies to prices *above* 75$ or 250$ respectively.\n\nAm I the asshole for even trying to pay 0$ for a ticket to an educational camp?\n\nEDIT: Thank you, kind strangers of reddit.

The 2 year old is crying about who knows what and the 4 and 5 year old are bickering very loudly. It took them all about 5 mins to really get on my nerves I didn't want to cause a scene by confronting the parents directly so I talked to an employee about getting a different table but we were a party of 6 so unfortunately we couldn't be accommodated the employee however tell us she would talk to the family which we saw her do. Not even another 5 minutes goes by and the 4 and 5 year old are smacking the table loudly complaining about them being hungry and keep in mind they're being quite loud and the parents are doing fuck all about it. I decided to not say anything to anyone because I figured that the staff would handle it, I was wrong.

So, I\u2019ve known my stepmom since I was 8 and we for the the first few years were very close and fought only semi-often (over arguably little things) and since I was young she was able to gaslight me (almost always in a public place or in front of family and people I cared about)  and then she would run off crying leaving me alone with everyone glaring at me. Along with the fights she would make fun of me in front of her work friends about things I did or did not do. A lot of this though could just be considered white lies but, it really embarrassed me at the time. And this is how it was for a while till she got pregnant, once she had (as she proudly told her mom while I was next to her) \u201cher own kid finally\u201d. I got older and wiser to the situation and got really depressed about this and have only recently been getting better, and part of that was avoiding her as much as possible. This has caused more fights and this morning we had one of the biggest ones in recent memory and I just went off one her about how I did not like her and the things she did to me, and has started to do to my half brother (now 2.5). I ended the fight saying I did not want to ever repair the relationship as every single time it comes back to bite me in the butt. I went back into my room and my dad and I have been talking and he thinks I\u2019m just mad at petty things and I should just make up since I live with them (I am in high school). So now I don\u2019t know if I am over exaggerating as it really was a bunch of little things. So am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the responses I will try to follow your advice.
