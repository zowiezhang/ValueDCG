I waited while he continued getting ready and packing his clothes.. Nearly an hour later we were both in the car ready to set off. It was 19:20.

He lives in a house with 3 other people, owned by one girl. It's a super nice house, and they're all good friends. At first I was a bit apprehensive because two of the housemates are girls, but I met them early and they seemed cool.\n\nUntil this past weekend, that is. The house threw a party, which I heard are always amazing. I was invited, and I wanted to bring my emotional support dog, Sadie, to the party with me. I have really bad anxiety sometimes and she helps a lot. Sadie is super well behaved and a medium sized dog, so I thought it would be no problem, plus people really love her especially at parties. She's a total ham. I even put her ESA harness on her. But when we got to the door, my boyfriend and housemate (the house owner) opened up and she looked a little pissed. She said Sadie can't come into the party, that it's not a good environment for a dog, and she wasn't given advance notice so that she could at least dogproof. But why would I give notice that I am bringing my support animal with me?\n\nSo I asked her what if I was blind or epileptic and needed a dog. She said if I was blind she would have been happy to make arrangements beforehand for me, and that if I was epileptic that party wouldn't be a good environment for me anyway, as there are strobes and loud music which also aren't great for dogs, totally missing the point. I kept arguing with her about the legally protected status of my dog, and she just kept saying it doesn't apply for private property.

He lives in a house with 3 other people, owned by one girl. It's a super nice house, and they're all good friends. At first I was a bit apprehensive because two of the housemates are girls, but I met them early and they seemed cool.\n\nUntil this past weekend, that is. The house threw a party, which I heard are always amazing. I was invited, and I wanted to bring my emotional support dog, Sadie, to the party with me. I have really bad anxiety sometimes and she helps a lot. Sadie is super well behaved and a medium sized dog, so I thought it would be no problem, plus people really love her especially at parties. She's a total ham. I even put her ESA harness on her. But when we got to the door, my boyfriend and housemate (the house owner) opened up and she looked a little pissed. She said Sadie can't come into the party, that it's not a good environment for a dog, and she wasn't given advance notice so that she could at least dogproof. But why would I give notice that I am bringing my support animal with me?\n\nSo I asked her what if I was blind or epileptic and needed a dog. She said if I was blind she would have been happy to make arrangements beforehand for me, and that if I was epileptic that party wouldn't be a good environment for me anyway, as there are strobes and loud music which also aren't great for dogs, totally missing the point. I kept arguing with her about the legally protected status of my dog, and she just kept saying it doesn't apply for private property.

We rent out the garage in my mother's house. I buy my own groceries, I have my own DIY kitchen. I stay to my room and only venture out to the rest of the house to see my mother and siblings or go to the bathroom. \n\nThe other morning I got woken up to loud banging on my door, like really fucking loud. I knew right away it was police as throughout my childhood my house had been raided quite a few times due to my mothers actions. I'm not gonna get specific about what she did/is currently doing, mostly because I try to know as little as possible. \n\nI freaked out because I was butt-naked and they were about to come in any minute. I jumped up and got dressed as fast as I could while my boyfriend tried his best to hide our bong and stash. Not well considering he only had 10-15 seconds. We get pushed out of our rooms and told we are being detained. At this point it's me, my boyfriend, my mum and my sister sitting on the couch in the loungeroom at about 8:30am surrounded by 6 cops. I'm annoyed as all hell because as per usual I'm dragged into whatever my mum has done. After the police do the standard procedures (stating why they're there, showing us proof of the warrant etc.) They ask my boyfriend to come up to our room while they search. They flat out ask him if they're gonna find anything. Knowing that everything wasn't hidden very well and it wouldn't take police long to find it, he told them what they might find. \n\nNaturally they confiscated our bong, weed (about a q), scissors, pretty much anything to do with pot. Because my boyfriend was honest about it and cooperated with the police they gave him a slap on the wrist and told him he had to go to a drug diversion class. Obviously they found jackshit when it came to mum (the actual reason they were there). Now at this point we're kind of annoyed. I call her later that day, in the afternoon while I'm out. I mentioned that my boyfriend and I were gonna take $150 out of the $370 rent we owe. She kind of chuckled and asked why we didn't hide it well. I explained to her that I was completely nude and was focusing my efforts on not being nude. \n\nThe next day I went into my mothers room just to double check with her she knew I was serious about the rent thing. She told me that she wasn't willing to do that because it was our fault we got caught cause we didn't hide it well enough. She also added that a few people had mentioned that I was being unreasonable and that mum was being a pushover. We fought for a bit until she told to me to shut the fuck up so I walked away. Now all I'm wondering is am I being unreasonable? Should I just pay in full and move on?\n\nEDIT: A lot of people mentioned that I should be used to police raids by now. That's my fault for not being clear enough. I said it was a common occurrence throughout my childhood. I had moved out of home with my boyfriend and then when his lease ran up, we decided to sign a lease with my mum.

We rent out the garage in my mother's house. I buy my own groceries, I have my own DIY kitchen. I stay to my room and only venture out to the rest of the house to see my mother and siblings or go to the bathroom. \n\nThe other morning I got woken up to loud banging on my door, like really fucking loud. I knew right away it was police as throughout my childhood my house had been raided quite a few times due to my mothers actions. I'm not gonna get specific about what she did/is currently doing, mostly because I try to know as little as possible. \n\nI freaked out because I was butt-naked and they were about to come in any minute. I jumped up and got dressed as fast as I could while my boyfriend tried his best to hide our bong and stash. Not well considering he only had 10-15 seconds. We get pushed out of our rooms and told we are being detained. At this point it's me, my boyfriend, my mum and my sister sitting on the couch in the loungeroom at about 8:30am surrounded by 6 cops. I'm annoyed as all hell because as per usual I'm dragged into whatever my mum has done. After the police do the standard procedures (stating why they're there, showing us proof of the warrant etc.) They ask my boyfriend to come up to our room while they search. They flat out ask him if they're gonna find anything. Knowing that everything wasn't hidden very well and it wouldn't take police long to find it, he told them what they might find. \n\nNaturally they confiscated our bong, weed (about a q), scissors, pretty much anything to do with pot. Because my boyfriend was honest about it and cooperated with the police they gave him a slap on the wrist and told him he had to go to a drug diversion class. Obviously they found jackshit when it came to mum (the actual reason they were there). Now at this point we're kind of annoyed. I call her later that day, in the afternoon while I'm out. I mentioned that my boyfriend and I were gonna take $150 out of the $370 rent we owe. She kind of chuckled and asked why we didn't hide it well. I explained to her that I was completely nude and was focusing my efforts on not being nude. \n\nThe next day I went into my mothers room just to double check with her she knew I was serious about the rent thing. She told me that she wasn't willing to do that because it was our fault we got caught cause we didn't hide it well enough. She also added that a few people had mentioned that I was being unreasonable and that mum was being a pushover. We fought for a bit until she told to me to shut the fuck up so I walked away. Now all I'm wondering is am I being unreasonable? Should I just pay in full and move on?\n\nEDIT: A lot of people mentioned that I should be used to police raids by now. That's my fault for not being clear enough. I said it was a common occurrence throughout my childhood. I had moved out of home with my boyfriend and then when his lease ran up, we decided to sign a lease with my mum. Before we did anything I told her that I was feeling uneasy about moving in with her due to past things like raids and abusive boyfriends. She promised me things would be different and that she was gonna stop doing whatever she does.

We all moved in at the same time about a year ago and the landlord does not live in the house. Early on it became clear that unless I did most of the maintenance (snow shoveling, yard work etc.) it would not get done by anybody. I honestly don't mind doing it as I would rather look at a nice neat home and it gives me an excuse to get outside. That being said I have never even had gotten so much as a \"thanks\" from anyone else in the house.\n\nI wont deny that this has built up a fair bit of resentment. The main floor tenants are also very inconsiderate with noise. Stomping in the doors and walking around with boots and hard shoes at night, having parties mid week and leaving their yappy dogs home alone barking all night on a regular basis. I have never complained to the landlord or the city about the noise and always addressed them directly in a respectful way rather than trying to get them in trouble.\n\nClearly this is about more than just Tide pods.\n\nWe share a laundry room with the main floor tenants and the top floor tenant has their own. There is a row of cupboards and we each have our own to keep laundry and cleaning supplies in and to this point I just trusted that no one would steal things like that from their neighbour. Well I had noticed that we seemed to be going through our pods rather quickly so I took a peek in their cupboard and saw that they didn't have any of our own so I decided to do a little experiment. I simply counted how many were in the tub waited until they did laundry and then counted them again. Sure enough there were two pods less. So I took the remaining pods out of the laundry room and left the empty tub on the dryer with a note that said \"buy your own, thief.\"\n\nFor what it's worth if they had asked I would have gladly given them whatever they needed.\n\nLater on that day one of them texted my S/O apologizing and saying they were \"in a bind\" and would replace the pod later.

We all moved in at the same time about a year ago and the landlord does not live in the house. Early on it became clear that unless I did most of the maintenance (snow shoveling, yard work etc.) it would not get done by anybody. I honestly don't mind doing it as I would rather look at a nice neat home and it gives me an excuse to get outside. That being said I have never even had gotten so much as a \"thanks\" from anyone else in the house.\n\nI wont deny that this has built up a fair bit of resentment. The main floor tenants are also very inconsiderate with noise. Stomping in the doors and walking around with boots and hard shoes at night, having parties mid week and leaving their yappy dogs home alone barking all night on a regular basis. I have never complained to the landlord or the city about the noise and always addressed them directly in a respectful way rather than trying to get them in trouble.\n\nClearly this is about more than just Tide pods.\n\nWe share a laundry room with the main floor tenants and the top floor tenant has their own. There is a row of cupboards and we each have our own to keep laundry and cleaning supplies in and to this point I just trusted that no one would steal things like that from their neighbour. Well I had noticed that we seemed to be going through our pods rather quickly so I took a peek in their cupboard and saw that they didn't have any of our own so I decided to do a little experiment. I simply counted how many were in the tub waited until they did laundry and then counted them again. Sure enough there were two pods less. So I took the remaining pods out of the laundry room and left the empty tub on the dryer with a note that said \"buy your own, thief.\"\n\nFor what it's worth if they had asked I would have gladly given them whatever they needed.\n\nLater on that day one of them texted my S/O apologizing and saying they were \"in a bind\" and would replace the pod later. They played it off as if it was a one time thing which I do not believe although admittedly o do not have any proof one way or the other. Either way later on that day there was a whole new tub of pods outside my door. \n\nI am satisfied with the outcome.

While he is technically the family dog,  I have paid for all his needs (food, supplies, pet insurance, etc) and I\u2019m the only one who feeds and walks him (but he still gets love and attention from the rest of my family). I\u2019m perfectly okay with this setup since it was what we agreed to when my parents allowed me to adopt him. This fall, I\u2019ll be attending a school hours away from my home and I can't take the dog with me. I had originally planned to attend a school nearby so that I would still be able to live at home, but some unexpected issues came up.\n\nWhile I would love nothing more than for my dog to be able to live at home with my family even when I\u2019m gone, I don\u2019t think they will be able to adequately care for him. My parents work most of the day and it would be difficult for them to contribute, and my sister (13f) just isn\u2019t interested in the responsibility portion that comes with having a pet. I have plans to give him to some of our family friends that live just a couple streets away from us- they just lost their beloved dog last year and are looking to adopt. They are very close to us and my dog absolutely adores them, he has known them his whole life. They have dog-sat multiple times and are in a position where they would be able to take very good care of him. Since they are practically like family, we see them all the time just for dinners and stuff. If my dog was to go live with them, I know my family would be able to see him whenever they wanted.\n\nI talked it over with my parents, and although they aren\u2019t super happy about it they understand and say that it\u2019s ultimately my choice. My sister on the other hand is absolutely livid with me. I completely agree why she would be upset, but she has made no effort to step up to the plate to actually take care of him. I\u2019ve given her multiple trial weeks where I\u2019ll ask her to be responsible for the dog\u2019s basic needs, and every single time she hasn\u2019t put in effort. I\u2019ll have to remind her multiple times when it\u2019s walk or feeding time, but she still did it only when she felt like it, if even at all. I had to pick up her slack every single week we tried. I\u2019m worried when I\u2019m not there, it\u2019ll be even worse with no one reminding her. The dog shouldn\u2019t have to suffer.\n\nRight now I\u2019m pretty convinced rehoming will be what\u2019s best for my dog, but my sister still isn't happy. She has brought up the fact that I\u2019d be taking away the only home and family my dog has ever known, and to her the dog she\u2019s had for as long as she can remember. I know he\u2019s entirely comfortable with the family/home he would be going to, but I would never want him to feel abandoned. And I do love my sister and I know she loves my dog, but I just can\u2019t bring myself to trust her to take care of him after she failed to prove to me that she could during the various opportunities I gave her.

While he is technically the family dog,  I have paid for all his needs (food, supplies, pet insurance, etc) and I\u2019m the only one who feeds and walks him (but he still gets love and attention from the rest of my family). I\u2019m perfectly okay with this setup since it was what we agreed to when my parents allowed me to adopt him. This fall, I\u2019ll be attending a school hours away from my home and I can't take the dog with me. I had originally planned to attend a school nearby so that I would still be able to live at home, but some unexpected issues came up.\n\nWhile I would love nothing more than for my dog to be able to live at home with my family even when I\u2019m gone, I don\u2019t think they will be able to adequately care for him. My parents work most of the day and it would be difficult for them to contribute, and my sister (13f) just isn\u2019t interested in the responsibility portion that comes with having a pet. I have plans to give him to some of our family friends that live just a couple streets away from us- they just lost their beloved dog last year and are looking to adopt. They are very close to us and my dog absolutely adores them, he has known them his whole life. They have dog-sat multiple times and are in a position where they would be able to take very good care of him. Since they are practically like family, we see them all the time just for dinners and stuff. If my dog was to go live with them, I know my family would be able to see him whenever they wanted.\n\nI talked it over with my parents, and although they aren\u2019t super happy about it they understand and say that it\u2019s ultimately my choice. My sister on the other hand is absolutely livid with me. I completely agree why she would be upset, but she has made no effort to step up to the plate to actually take care of him. I\u2019ve given her multiple trial weeks where I\u2019ll ask her to be responsible for the dog\u2019s basic needs, and every single time she hasn\u2019t put in effort. I\u2019ll have to remind her multiple times when it\u2019s walk or feeding time, but she still did it only when she felt like it, if even at all. I had to pick up her slack every single week we tried. I\u2019m worried when I\u2019m not there, it\u2019ll be even worse with no one reminding her. The dog shouldn\u2019t have to suffer.\n\nRight now I\u2019m pretty convinced rehoming will be what\u2019s best for my dog, but my sister still isn't happy. She has brought up the fact that I\u2019d be taking away the only home and family my dog has ever known, and to her the dog she\u2019s had for as long as she can remember. I know he\u2019s entirely comfortable with the family/home he would be going to, but I would never want him to feel abandoned. And I do love my sister and I know she loves my dog, but I just can\u2019t bring myself to trust her to take care of him after she failed to prove to me that she could during the various opportunities I gave her.

We have plans to move in together this summer ready for next year.\n* My parents have done a complete 180 and now want me to forgive them so badly that they're still refusing to sign a letter showing they've cut me off, so I'm still fucked with student finance. My parents have also offered me my truck back, so me, my roommate, and 2 more friends will be going to my parents' house some time soon to collect my truck and some things from my room. My tutor has written a letter for me for student finance which they might accept but I'm waiting to hear back.\n* My course changes were approved so now I'm doing what I want, not what my parents want, and it looks like I got my work placement, so I'll be either working and studying part time for 2 years or working all next year and finishing studies the year after. Either way I'll be adding an extra year to my course but I get paid and get relevant experience in my field.\n\nUltimately, everything seems to have worked out as well as it could.

My tutor has written a letter for me for student finance which they might accept but I'm waiting to hear back.\n* My course changes were approved so now I'm doing what I want, not what my parents want, and it looks like I got my work placement, so I'll be either working and studying part time for 2 years or working all next year and finishing studies the year after. Either way I'll be adding an extra year to my course but I get paid and get relevant experience in my field.\n\nUltimately, everything seems to have worked out as well as it could. Thanks to everyone who commented because a lot of you had great advice and thought of stuff I didn't, and I was truly concerned that I was in the wrong so thanks for the reassurance, too. I will also be booking a session with the on campus mental health professional because this has really shone a light on just how fucked up my family is.

So I set up the baby sitter for the kids. I work until 5. Sitter comes at 6. Game starts at 7. \n\nTomorrow is the game. This morning, husband said to me \u201cHow about we skip the game, and go to dinner and a movie instead?\u201d I asked why. He said \u201cThe game doesn\u2019t start until 7, it probably won\u2019t end until 9. I have to be up early for work\u201d I said \u201cOkay but I am not sure how dinner and a movie would get us home earlier? We don\u2019t have a sitter until 6. And I already got the tickets to the game. And I already invited my dad\u201d. \n\nHis face dropped. He said \u201cI thought that was MY decision?\u201d I said \u201cWell it was, but you just kept saying you didn\u2019t care, and I figured you really didn\u2019t care, so I invited him\u201d\n\nHe stopped talking and just said \u201ck\u201d. I can tell he is upset. I said \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I did try to ask what you wanted. I had to make a decision and this was what I decided.\u201d And he just continued to not respond to me (yes this was in PERSON) and then I had to go to work.

He had to be in school by 9, I had a day off, I went for a run around 8 and was gone about an hour. In that time my brother did not wake up. I had a deadline at 12noon so I got back from my run, showered, put my headphones in and started the final edits on my assignment. I assumed that he had woken up and gone to school in the time I was out running, it never occurred to me that he was still sleeping. Around 11:30 my brother woke up and came downstairs. He yelled at me for not waking him, and I replied that I was sorry he was running late but it's really not my job to wake him, and told him that if he wanted I could ring in to his school and make up an excuse for him being late. The whole time I was saying this I was also on my laptop, editing my coursework, and he asked me if I could drive him. I said that my coursework was due in less than half an hour and I'm not finished, and told him when the next bus is.\n\nHe then took my laptop and threw it. It hit the opposite wall and broke in half at the hinge. I tried to turn it back on but it wasn't working. I then drove to the nearest library, found my backup (which had a bit less editing but most of it was there) and uploaded that. I was exactly 7 minutes late. At my university they don't care if it's 7 seconds late, anything beyond the deadline gets referred, meaning the grade is capped at 40%, which is the minimum for a pass. This happened to my grade, so I got 40% on this assignment when my average grade is 78% and my lecturer has told me that my essay was worth 94%, but because it was in late there's nothing she could do.\n\nI had insurance on the laptop, but it didn't kick in until I'd had the laptop for 45 days, and I was on day 37. Because of this, the company won't replace or fix it. Mum has said my brother needs to buy me a new laptop. When I bought the (now broken) laptop it was full price at \u00a3250. It's not a very good laptop, only 2gb of memory, it was just meant for writing up assignments. Now, because of black Friday, the laptop is on sale for \u00a3129. The same laptop has other models with more storage and better battery life and stuff like that, and the model that is 2 up from my one (8gb memory) is on sale for \u00a3239. My brother does not know which version I got.\n\nWIBTA if I told my brother that he needs to get me the better model?\n\nInfo for people asking: He did have an alarm. It wakes *me* a lot of the time, and I'm in the next room over. He wakes up, turns it off, sometimes he'll do something, like eat or go to the bathroom, and then he'll just go back to sleep. No way to tell most days whether he stayed awake or not.\n\nAlso, I know I shouldn't have left it so late, but the uni submission area only lets you upload your assignment once and then the submission area closes.

He had to be in school by 9, I had a day off, I went for a run around 8 and was gone about an hour. In that time my brother did not wake up. I had a deadline at 12noon so I got back from my run, showered, put my headphones in and started the final edits on my assignment. I assumed that he had woken up and gone to school in the time I was out running, it never occurred to me that he was still sleeping. Around 11:30 my brother woke up and came downstairs. He yelled at me for not waking him, and I replied that I was sorry he was running late but it's really not my job to wake him, and told him that if he wanted I could ring in to his school and make up an excuse for him being late. The whole time I was saying this I was also on my laptop, editing my coursework, and he asked me if I could drive him. I said that my coursework was due in less than half an hour and I'm not finished, and told him when the next bus is.\n\nHe then took my laptop and threw it. It hit the opposite wall and broke in half at the hinge. I tried to turn it back on but it wasn't working. I then drove to the nearest library, found my backup (which had a bit less editing but most of it was there) and uploaded that. I was exactly 7 minutes late. At my university they don't care if it's 7 seconds late, anything beyond the deadline gets referred, meaning the grade is capped at 40%, which is the minimum for a pass. This happened to my grade, so I got 40% on this assignment when my average grade is 78% and my lecturer has told me that my essay was worth 94%, but because it was in late there's nothing she could do.\n\nI had insurance on the laptop, but it didn't kick in until I'd had the laptop for 45 days, and I was on day 37. Because of this, the company won't replace or fix it. Mum has said my brother needs to buy me a new laptop. When I bought the (now broken) laptop it was full price at \u00a3250. It's not a very good laptop, only 2gb of memory, it was just meant for writing up assignments. Now, because of black Friday, the laptop is on sale for \u00a3129. The same laptop has other models with more storage and better battery life and stuff like that, and the model that is 2 up from my one (8gb memory) is on sale for \u00a3239. My brother does not know which version I got.\n\nWIBTA if I told my brother that he needs to get me the better model?\n\nInfo for people asking: He did have an alarm. It wakes *me* a lot of the time, and I'm in the next room over. He wakes up, turns it off, sometimes he'll do something, like eat or go to the bathroom, and then he'll just go back to sleep. No way to tell most days whether he stayed awake or not.\n\nAlso, I know I shouldn't have left it so late, but the uni submission area only lets you upload your assignment once and then the submission area closes. They're trying to fix it so you can upload as many times as you want, but right now you only get one upload, so most people wait until the last minute to get as much time to edit as possible.\n\nMy average grade was 78% before this, the 40% took it down to 68%.

That\u2019s what her mom told me, niece looks just like him, and even Tim himself has said that she\u2019s most likely his(he never said this to me as we\u2019ve rarely interacted but many mutual friends have said he\u2019s never denied her). We live in a small town so he\u2019s always been around but she never expressed interest in meeting him. She knew about the Tim Scott guy from her mom but never even mentioned him to me. \n\n\n\nAnyway, my niece recently goes to a birthday party at her friend Kate\u2019s house. Kate\u2019s dad and I are not close friends but he was very close to my sister prior to her drug addiction so the girls have been friends since birth. I had to work the day of the party so her babysitter dropped her off. \n\n\n\nI go to pick her up and she\u2019s in a secluded area, sitting down with Tim Scott. I asked Kate\u2019s dad what is going on and he says he asked niece if she wanted to meet Tim Scott, she said yes, so he called him up and told him to come over. \n\n\n\nI was furious with Kate\u2019s dad. It just seemed like such a boundary to cross. I\u2019m not saying I wouldn\u2019t let her meet him but there\u2019s so much we need to talk about first. \n\n\nTim Scott was nice about it i suppose. She said he just asked her what sports she plays and about school. Kate\u2019s dad gave him our Number(wtf?). He later called to apologize and said he didn\u2019t realize I wasn\u2019t aware of the situation. He invited her to meet his family and said he\u2019d like to come to some of her games.\n\n\nI really laid in on Kate\u2019s dad. I told him under no circumstances will niece be allowed back over there without me present the entire time. I said his acts were careless, childish, and selfish. We have no idea how this situation will play out and no idea how it will affect niece. On top of that, there\u2019s also a chance he\u2019s not even her dad.

At first, they were playing ok but after 15 minutes my kid came to me crying saying that the nephew pushed him over. I brushed it off at first and told my kid that it was an accident. He understood so he came back to the nephew to play again. After an hour, my kid came to me and said he's scared to go near my SO's nephew because he presses his weight on him and that my son couldn't breathe while he sits on top of him. The nephew is more than double my kid's weight.\n\nI told what happened to my SO and he said that that's just how his nephew horse around. He said that he's like that when he becomes fond of the kid he plays with. I told my SO that I am not ok with that but he looked at me like I was overreacting. I also told the mother of the nephew what happened but she just shrugged it off and basically told me that my kid's fine and they were just playing. Every one in my So's family seem to think that the kid is okay but to me, he needs help.\n\nNow the kid is already 7 but does not speak at all. He just gestures for whatever he wants. Also, the fact that he pushes people around and sits on top of them got me thinking that the kid could have a spectrum of autism. Of course that is not for me to diagnose so I told my SO that they need to get the kid checked so we'll know what type of care he needs. Until then, I refuse to bring my kid to any family gatherings if I knew the nephew will be there. My SO and his family think that I am a dick because I don't trust them and this is a huge deal-breaker for us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I asked my SO why the kid is not speaking at his age but they all didn't know. So no diagnosis yet. The kid has not been checked for anything and they solution for it is to have the kid enrolled in a school so he can have some sort of an interaction. I don't know how well he does in the school. I just want SO's nephew to have all the help that he needs so he can grow normal. We all have to admit that any 7 y/o that is completely silent and is not deaf, isn't normal.\n\nAlso, I appreciate all the replies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2: I am a female. Sorry, that was a typo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 3: We live in the Philippines.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 4: Again, the fact that he pushes people around and sits on top of them got me thinking that the kid could have a spectrum of autism. Of course that is not for me to diagnose so I told my SO that they need to get the kid checked so we'll know what type of care he needs. Until then, I refuse to bring my kid to any family gatherings if I knew the nephew will be there.\n\nI am not saying that he gets tested specifically for Autism, I am only saying that he needs to have medical intervention so we'll know how we can help the nephew further to be better. Also, I do not want to bring my kid anymore because my son is the only kid there within the nephew's age group and I don't want him to feel isolated because my son is scared of going near him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 5: Again, I am not saying/diagnosing that the kid has autism. I am simply implying that they got him checked out by a medical practitioner, not just for autism; because the kid never had any medical intervention.\"\nGiven value: \"unrelated to commonsense\" [/INST]", "WHY_A": " Attribution Analysis: The sentence reflects a lack of trust in the nephew's behavior because the speaker's son was pushed over and sat on, and the nephew does not speak at all.\n\nCounterfactual Analysis: If the nephew did not have any behavioral issues, the sentence would not reflect a lack of trust.\n\nRebuttal Argument: An opposing view might be that the speaker is overreacting and being too cautious, but the fact that the nephew has not received any medical intervention and the family does not seem to be addressing the issue raises concerns about the nephew's well-being.\n\nAttribution Analysis: The sentence reflects a lack of trust in the nephew's behavior because the speaker's son was pushed over and sat on, and the nephew does not speak at all.\n\nCounterfactual Analysis: If the nephew did not have any behavior", "gpt_eval_result": {"a_score": 1.0, "c_score": 3.0, "r_score": 2.0}}, {"label": 1, "input": "I bit the mouse", "WHAT": "B", "WHY_Q": "<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

He had received +90% on his essays and projects through the term, but had a \\~60% on participation and classwork. Projects and essay were weighted in the gradebook, but in spite of that, Bill still was at a B.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI explained that his behavior in class (frequently being on his phone, distracting neighbors, randomly yelling \"Timmy time\" during class) impacted others and showed that he wasn't interested in the class. He tried to argue things like that since he turned in the final draft, he shouldn't be penalized for not doing any of the pre-work or the rough draft.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI decided to let him write an essay that explains why he deserves an A and that I would bump his grade. I want to stress this part while I said that the essay would need to be in MLA style, I did not specify that I would be deciding this based on the content of the essay. I sort of felt that writing an essay is an extra credit task, doesn't need too much scaffolding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast day of school, Bill turns in an essay that was not in MLA style.  I glance at it, but don't read it and tell him I will put it in the gradebook. Bill did not stay, and its probably a good thing. His essay had two main arguments: participation should not be a factor in grading and only end products should be considered and that I, being visually impaired, cannot assess a class accurately on participation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNeedless to say he did not get an A. But am I the A-hole? Does it seem like I broke a verbal agreement with the student and cheated him out of an A?

This discount is doubled during the last hour the stores are open to -60%, so I often go the store at this time.  \n  \nI arrived at the store about half an hour before the last hour, so I'd find the best discounts. I also spend some time on my phone searching for recipes based on the ingredients that I find, so that I can buy other needed ingredients at the same time. \n  \nLast night I got lucky and found the biggest amount of discounted food so far, so I pretty much filled my shopping cart completely. I have a large freezer though so there is no chance the food will go to waste.  \n  \nA few minutes before the double discount begins, I see a woman come in, walk around the store and find nothing. She then sees my cart and asks if she could have a few products. I refuse and tell her she should have come in earlier. She gets mad, saying she can't really afford food at the normal price, and that I look like I don't need the discount (I guess this is sort of true, I'm decently well off but I live extremely frugally, which has been a big part of my good financial status.) I tell her that it's not my problem, and start walking towards the checkout. She then goes and complains to a worker that it isn't fair that someone hoards all the food, but the worker says that it's not against their rules/policies. She then cusses at me while leaving.\n\nTL;DR: Bought lots of discounted food, poor woman asks if she can buy some of it instead, I refuse and she swears and yells at me.

I told her it was my clothes and therefore my decision. I told her to ask another co-worker to which Anna told me she couldn't as she hadn't officially given her two weeks yet (she was going to do this after signing her offer letter) and didn't want to explain to someone why they absolutely needed to switch shirts with her. I told her that wasn't my problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEventually Anna ended up pulling a co-worker aside and explaining the situation and the co-worker switched shirts with her. Anna looked pretty ridciouls as she was wearing white dress pants and the shirt she got was a white blouse, which I did feel sorta bad for, but I didn't feel bad for saying no.

Her new boss wanted her to come into the office after work one day to sign the offer letter in person as well as take her out for dinner with her new team.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnna was ecstatic and dressed nicely for work that day as she would have to leave right at 5 in order to get into the city on time. Now here's where the issue comes in. Right around 4-4:30 Anna rushes over to my desk and I notice that a blue pen had exploded all over her pink blouse. The colors matter because there was clearly no hiding it, the ink had ruined the shirt, not even a washer was going to be able to get the color out. She asked me if we could change shirts so that she didn't have to go meet her new boss / team members with a ruined shirt as she would look unprofessional. I told her no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe asked me why, and I told her I just didn't feel like switching shirts and wearing a stained shirt going home. Anna told me that it was ridiculous because I just had to drive home in the stained shirt and could change there where as she had to go straight into the city from work and had no option to go home to change beforehand. I told her it was my clothes and therefore my decision. I told her to ask another co-worker to which Anna told me she couldn't as she hadn't officially given her two weeks yet (she was going to do this after signing her offer letter) and didn't want to explain to someone why they absolutely needed to switch shirts with her. I told her that wasn't my problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEventually Anna ended up pulling a co-worker aside and explaining the situation and the co-worker switched shirts with her. Anna looked pretty ridciouls as she was wearing white dress pants and the shirt she got was a white blouse, which I did feel sorta bad for, but I didn't feel bad for saying no. A lot of our mutual friends said I was being ridiculous and should have just switched with her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Wow this blew up, honestly I still don't really think I did anything that wrong, at the end of the day my property is my property and thats how I feel. Plus Anna had just ruined her own shirt with ink how could I trust that she wouldn't ruin mine? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason I included everything about what Anna has done for me is because she really is an amazing friend and I respect the hell out of her, I didn't want to make it seem like I didn't appreciate everything she has done for me because I DO, I just didn't want to give her my shirt and her and I were in a disagreement on that so I decided to leave it to reddit. I guess I'll accept my fate of YTA but I still don't think people need to let friends use their things that they own. \"\nGiven value: \"be commonsense\" [/INST]", "WHY_A": " Sure, I'd be happy to help!

We live in a large progressive city and have run into a modern wedding ethics dilemma.  We have multiple guests attending that are in polyamorous relationships.  Not a problem, or so we thought.  All of these guests happen to be in a relationship with a single primary. So naturally, they are all bringing their primary with them to our wedding as their plus one.\n\nOne couple we have known for a long time, such that one will be our MC for the evening.  The other is now asking for additional \"plus one\" as we are taking their partner away for most of the evening so they will be \"alone\".  They haven't been dating this other person very long, but honestly, we do know this person better than most of the out of town family we are inviting.  With a few rejected invites we could definitely accommodate them easily without impacting our budget.\n\nHowever, we don't want to give them any more invites.  It's just a matter of principal.  While we could accommodate one additional person, we could not accommodate a bunch of additional invites.  The \"plus one\" rule is tidy as it can apply to anyone, poly or not.\n\nSo WWBTA (Would We) if we denied them an additional invite? Logically we think we are ok, but this couple is doing a lot for our wedding (beyond just the MC thing) and we kinda feel like dicks for not accommodating them at all.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nHi All,\n\nThanks for the replies.  For reasons we will elaborate on shortly, this topic is a hot piece of gossip right now in our friend group, so we appreciate being able to put it out there to a neutral party.\n\nThis request was not normal for the couple in question.  Wife has known them for 10 years, Husband for 7 and only once have we met any of the additional members of their relationship and that was for a board game night.  They share what is going on in their relationship, but still keep it separate from the larger friend group by their own choice.  This new person is different.  We see them a lot.  It's all good though.  Everyone seems happy, the new person is cool, so why would we judge?\n\nNormally, we would seek advice from our friend group, but we knew this would be fire.  This big change in their relationship is already creating a lot of talk, and news that they would be coming to our wedding would be out of our control once it is out there.\n\n...so we are disinviting all of them so they don't steal attention on our big day...\n\nJOKING! We kid... we kid...\n\nWe talked to the couple, told them we would be giving this person an individual invite as part of our \"B list\".  We also asked their permission to put this info out publicly so if any drama comes from it, it will die down before the wedding.  They were cool with it. We also showed them this thread and had a good laugh.\n\nSo we put it out there to another of our polyamorous friends and they were far from offended.  Their reaction was literally, \"oooooooooooohhhh, so they are seriously now then?\"  \n\nThanks everyone!

We live in a large progressive city and have run into a modern wedding ethics dilemma.  We have multiple guests attending that are in polyamorous relationships.  Not a problem, or so we thought.  All of these guests happen to be in a relationship with a single primary. So naturally, they are all bringing their primary with them to our wedding as their plus one.\n\nOne couple we have known for a long time, such that one will be our MC for the evening.  The other is now asking for additional \"plus one\" as we are taking their partner away for most of the evening so they will be \"alone\".  They haven't been dating this other person very long, but honestly, we do know this person better than most of the out of town family we are inviting.  With a few rejected invites we could definitely accommodate them easily without impacting our budget.\n\nHowever, we don't want to give them any more invites.  It's just a matter of principal.  While we could accommodate one additional person, we could not accommodate a bunch of additional invites.  The \"plus one\" rule is tidy as it can apply to anyone, poly or not.\n\nSo WWBTA (Would We) if we denied them an additional invite? Logically we think we are ok, but this couple is doing a lot for our wedding (beyond just the MC thing) and we kinda feel like dicks for not accommodating them at all.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nHi All,\n\nThanks for the replies.  For reasons we will elaborate on shortly, this topic is a hot piece of gossip right now in our friend group, so we appreciate being able to put it out there to a neutral party.\n\nThis request was not normal for the couple in question.  Wife has known them for 10 years, Husband for 7 and only once have we met any of the additional members of their relationship and that was for a board game night.  They share what is going on in their relationship, but still keep it separate from the larger friend group by their own choice.  This new person is different.  We see them a lot.  It's all good though.  Everyone seems happy, the new person is cool, so why would we judge?\n\nNormally, we would seek advice from our friend group, but we knew this would be fire.  This big change in their relationship is already creating a lot of talk, and news that they would be coming to our wedding would be out of our control once it is out there.\n\n...so we are disinviting all of them so they don't steal attention on our big day...\n\nJOKING! We kid... we kid...\n\nWe talked to the couple, told them we would be giving this person an individual invite as part of our \"B list\".  We also asked their permission to put this info out publicly so if any drama comes from it, it will die down before the wedding.  They were cool with it. We also showed them this thread and had a good laugh.\n\nSo we put it out there to another of our polyamorous friends and they were far from offended.  Their reaction was literally, \"oooooooooooohhhh, so they are seriously now then?\"  \n\nThanks everyone! \"\nGiven value: \"unrelated to commonsense\" [/INST]", "WHY_A": " Sure, I'd be happy to help!

We will call F and M for this post. We have been dating for nearly 2 years\n\nM has 2 kids from a previous relationship that ended 4years ago. M and Ex(35) are on horrible terms and don't agree on much. They did share 50/50 care. When M start dating me, Ex took off with kids.\n\nWe uprooted our lives to be closer to kids and regain 50/50 care. Ex then says she want to move again 3/4 hours away with kids and refuses to allow M to see kids and makes up a bunch of false allegation. \n\nM and Ex go to a family court resolution which is a settle out of court kind of thing. Ex wants to move. M wants 50/50 care. M realised if he dosent settle he will have to go to court for 4 day trail in which everyone including kids will be examined. M has already spent nearly $90k plus in lawyer fees and cant afford it. M doesn't want kids examined and lets Ex move away with kids. He gets them every other weekend (EOW) and most of school holidays. \n\nI told M not to let kids moved because Ex hates him and will never promote a healthy relationship between himself and children. \nWell 6months later he sees kids EOW, no other contact because kids cant/Don't call him. He can't attend school function or be involved like he wanted.\n\nHe complains all the time about loosing kids. Blames it on Ex.

My daughter scratched hers and won $300. So I cashed them in and gave my daughter $100 and my stepdaughter the $10. \n\nMy stepdaughter was disappointed and my wife thinks I should have split up the money evenly so each of the girls got at least $55 to spend and $100 to save since the ticket and money were technically mine legally.\n\nI don\u2019t think splitting up my daughters money would have been fair to her. I certainly wouldn\u2019t have made my stepdaughter to give mine any of her winnings if she won more.\n\nEdit. Messed up on math. After taking out the $200 and splitting it up they  would get $55 spend.\n\nEdit 2. A lot of people seem to have missed the part where I explained the rule I had about them, so I\u2019ll repeat it. I am not keeping any of the money for myself. The $200 I didn\u2019t give my daughter went into her savings account that she can use when she\u2019s older.\n\nEdit 3. They\u2019re $1 scratchers. The grand prize is under $1000. So no need to worry about one of them winning thousands or millions.\n\nEdit 4. The scratchers were a small side present.
