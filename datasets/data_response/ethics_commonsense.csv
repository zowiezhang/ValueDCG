"AITA for making us 3 hours late? | So I think it's best if I set the scene first.
Myself and my friend were invited to a garden party at the weekend, we were both stopping over. The garden party started at 19:00ish.

My friend lives 40 minutes from me, and he is then an hour and 10 minutes from the party. I was driving and picking him up on the way.

The day before I had texted my friend and told him I would ""attempt"" to get to his house for 16:00ish, and that I wanted to detour slightly and pick something up on the way.

Well on the Saturday afternoon I didn't end up setting off to my friend until about 17:45. My fault and later than planned but we would still arrive at a good time. I rang my friend at 16:00 and told him I wouldn't pick him up until later, possibly around 18:00. He was relieved as he had not got ready and was binge watching stranger things...

I rang him when I had set off  telling him I would be there in half an hour. Again, he was relieved because he was STILL watching stranger things and hadn't got ready at all...fine I said, but please get ready now and we can get straight off when I get there...

I arrived at my friends at 18:25, I parked up and rang him... To my surprise he said he had 5 minutes left to watch to stranger things and invited me inside, he has still not packed and was not ready to go. ""No!"" I said, ""I will wait in the car come down where you are ready""

Well 20 minutes passed and I eventually went inside to use the facilities. I waited while he continued getting ready and packing his clothes.. Nearly an hour later we were both in the car ready to set off. It was 19:20. He had taken 55 minutes getting ready...

Bear in mind we are still over an hour from the garden party, 20:00 would have been an okay time to get there I had thought. I then reminded him that we need to take a 20 minute detour as I need to pick something up on the way. He then moaned at me saying to leave it and head straight there. I told him if I had known he was going to take an hour getting ready I could have driven there and back. I was not changing my plans, he had already made us late. He said if anyone enquired as to why we were so late he would blame me. Ludicrous I said.

Despite the tiff I still went on my detour which added 20 minutes to the journey. Certainly alot less than the 55 minutes I had to wait for him. Along the way I said we should probably stop off for somewhere to eat as the food will probably all have been eaten when we arrive. ""sure"" he replied.

Well an hour or so passed and we were about 10 minutes from the party. Despite his protests I stopped at a mcdonalds as I didn't want to drink on an empty stomach. I went inside as I needed a wee and brought some food out, including some nuggets for him. As I sat in the car eating my burgers he had a go at me for not driving and eating at the same time and how I had made us late (the time was about 21:00)

How had I made us late?! I argued. I had given him ample warning what time I was going to be there. He was binge watching Netflix. I said he was disrespectful as he should have been ready when I arrived. He accused me of being disrespectful for not being there at 16:00. But I would still have had to wait an hour for him to get ready?! And I informed him at every step the time I was due to arrive. 

He was not having it and declared that I was the reason we were late. And that what he would tell everyone. 

Am I the asshole for making us late?

--I let him know at 16:00 what time I was going to be there. But he hadn't even began to get ready.

If had been ready to go when I picked him up we would have got there at an appropriate time

"AITA for being upset my boyfriend let his baby mama approach and hang out with us in the club? | Basically the title. I (22f) have been dating my boyfriend(26) for three months now. He‚Äôs an amazing man and we‚Äôve had literally no issues up until this one. Prior to dating me, he had a longtime girlfriend from the age of 16 or so, on up until about five months before we started dating. They share a beautiful little girl together, who‚Äôs 10 months old, and the breakup was amicable. 

This past weekend, my boyfriend and I went out clubbing together, and just who do we run into but his baby mama. I saw her first, and made an effort to avoid her because I don‚Äôt really think she likes me, but that‚Äôs besides the point. I started tugging on my bf trying to get him to walk away with me, but he looked back and saw her, too, and waved. Que baby mama coming over to ‚Äúsay hello‚Äù to us, which turned into her hanging out with us for about an hour before going back to her friends. I just sat there on my phone while the two of them chatted it up, and I wasn‚Äôt even included in the conversation. Once she left, I decided I wanted to leave and my boyfriend got mad and said my ‚Äúpissy attitude‚Äù ruined his evening out. AITA here?! This isn‚Äôt normal, right?!

**You can all stop calling me an immature child now. He broke things off so it‚Äôs over and none of this matters anymore.**",1
"AITA if I ask my (23F) father why he is sending my brother (26M) thousands of dollars a month? | Pretty straight forward but here‚Äôs the dirty details: My dad upgraded his phone and gave me his old one, his email is either linked to mine or he left it logged in, something idk. Point being I have access to his emails. I didn‚Äôt log out because he has me take care of certain online bills for him, he‚Äôs not very computer literate (so he says). 

I‚Äôve been linked for a few months now and I‚Äôve been receiving notifications on my phone showing where my dad has Venmo‚Äôd my brother 1000s of dollars every month. Obviously I‚Äôm not supposed to be aware that this is happening. 

A little background on the family: My brother lives 2 hours from my dad, he is most definitely a substance abuser in hiding. He has been known to use people for money (whether they were his sugar daddy plain and simple or an older, wealthier man who didn‚Äôt know he was being used as a sugar daddy). My father is blindly unaware of these things. I do not really want to be the one to call my brother out, though I have several times in private to his face. 

My brothers roommate (also my ex girlfriend, long story) just passed away from an accidental drug overdose. My dad was sending my brother a couple thousand a month before this, but now my dad is sending almost double as much. I know for a fact that only one of them was on the lease and they lived in income-based housing. I only know this because my ex told me several months before she passed away. There is NO way my brother needs all that money. He owns his own website for selling clothes (paid for by sugar daddy #2), he also judges competitions on the weekends and I know he is paid well for it. 

Would I be the asshole for calling my dad and asking him WTF he is sending my brother all this cash for?? My dad is starting to go a little soft in the head, it‚Äôs fucked up for my brother to be digging into his money when my dad will certainly need it for retirement. His retirement is already drained from custody battles, hospital bills, his money-grubbing girlfriend.. 

I just want to help my dad, guys, but I‚Äôm scared if I come off as TA he will shut down and refuse to talk to me about it. My family is big on ‚Äúmind your own business.‚Äù Not to mention I‚Äôm kind of a disappointment myself. I also had a drug addiction, but I was honest with my dad about it, we got the help I needed, I‚Äôm recovered but that doesn‚Äôt mean my reputation is.. My dad doesn‚Äôt know it, but I live in my car on the west coast. I would never ask him for money regardless because I made the decision to come here and struggle until I could get on my feet. My choices, my problems. I can live in my car at 23 and be fine, if my dad can‚Äôt work anymore he will not be able to do the same comfortably. 

WIBTA for calling my brother out?

UPDATE: Calling my dad in about an hour, Ill let y‚Äôall know how it goes. Thanks for the advice and support guys, I‚Äôm not sure I would‚Äôve had the balls to address it had there not be an overwhelming response that I should. So thanks for the pressure/courage.

UPDATE: I called my father, he was aware of the money being transferred. He  confirmed to me that the death of my ex is the reason my brother is asking for so much money, and that he was helping him out before since my brothers SO stepped out of the picture not too long ago. My father was not aware that my brothers sugar daddy has been paying most of his bills, he was also pretty confused when I brought up the drug use but he seemed to accept it as a fact though he didn‚Äôt want to talk about it much. 

I told him I was not trying to cross any lines, but that I had noticed the transfers as they pinged my phone and I was concerned since he has some loans out on getting the house redone and he will probably want to retire someday. I avoided any mention of him being a victim or of him being fooled. He reassured me that he would be okay, he also told me he is not going to send anymore money to my brother as of right now. He will be calling him later not to confront him, but rather set up a repayment plan. I told him he is likely not to get anything back and I‚Äôve asked him to remove his information from Venmo just as a precaution. He was actually very pleased with me, when we got off the phone he was adamant that he was proud of me and ‚Äúloves me a whole bunch.‚Äù

All in all, I‚Äôm happy with how the situation turned out. I‚Äôm going to keep watch of his email, which he‚Äôs fine with, just to make sure nothing weird pops up. Thanks for seeing me through an awkward situation guys, I‚Äôm normally not the one to make waves but it feels really great to have done a solid for my dad.",0

"AITA for locking my father in law out of my house | My father in law shows up at my house unannounced. I‚Äôm pregnant and my husband works so my in laws have keys to our house in case something awful happens to me and he can‚Äôt get to me. 

My mother in law has never really abused the privilege. But my father in law does constantly.

He barges in with no warning, usually under the guise of wanting to help/ fix something, and then comes and critiques everything. 

My husband has asked him multiple times to stop, but he doesn‚Äôt, and I don‚Äôt want to take away the key in case we do have an emergency.

He came over the other day, again unannounced, and started talking about how he didn‚Äôt like the layout of our nursery. When he went out to his car to get something, I walked behind him and locked the door. He had his phone wallet and keys and all the things he brought so it‚Äôs not like he left anything here.

He called my husband and started yelling saying I was disrespectful, but I told him that he should know now not to show up unannounced.

AITA?",0
"AITA for arguing with my bf's housemate about my ESA? | So I just started dating this guy, we really click, he's great, yadda yadda. He lives in a house with 3 other people, owned by one girl. It's a super nice house, and they're all good friends. At first I was a bit apprehensive because two of the housemates are girls, but I met them early and they seemed cool.

Until this past weekend, that is. The house threw a party, which I heard are always amazing. I was invited, and I wanted to bring my emotional support dog, Sadie, to the party with me. I have really bad anxiety sometimes and she helps a lot. Sadie is super well behaved and a medium sized dog, so I thought it would be no problem, plus people really love her especially at parties. She's a total ham. I even put her ESA harness on her. But when we got to the door, my boyfriend and housemate (the house owner) opened up and she looked a little pissed. She said Sadie can't come into the party, that it's not a good environment for a dog, and she wasn't given advance notice so that she could at least dogproof. But why would I give notice that I am bringing my support animal with me?

So I asked her what if I was blind or epileptic and needed a dog. She said if I was blind she would have been happy to make arrangements beforehand for me, and that if I was epileptic that party wouldn't be a good environment for me anyway, as there are strobes and loud music which also aren't great for dogs, totally missing the point. I kept arguing with her about the legally protected status of my dog, and she just kept saying it doesn't apply for private property. This kept going on for like 15 minutes and she got more and more annoyed, saying she's seen me a hundred times out without the dog, but it's a party which is duh, where I'm more likely to have anxiety so of course I wanted her there.

After going back and forth she was basically like, ""look, the dog isn't coming into my house. That's final. You can put her in the backyard but that's it.""

While in the backyard, Sadie dug up some stuff because she's used to always being with me and I guess broke or chewed a chair. I'm fine with paying for those things if me and my bf stay together, but I kinda don't want to because if she'd just let my dog stay with me it wouldn't have even happened and because my bf didn't really take my side against his housemate and said it would be best if I don't bring Sadie over there again in the future as his housemate is really pissed.

AITA for getting into it with her?

&#x200B;

EDIT: For the people focused on me not wanting to pay, I said I didn't want to, not that I won't, but as I said in the comments:  The chewing in the backyard, I didn't even see, so I'm not even sure if it happened or if it was her and asked for pictures but still haven't seen any, and the flowers my bf sent me a picture, doesn't look like she dug them up, but instead was walking on them since they were right next to the backdoor and she wanted to get to me. I still get that I should have to pay if she messed up the flowers, that's not the point.

ALSO: My argument wasn't that she's legally allowed to be in the house, just that it's dickish to refuse because it's a support animal. It was more than my dog is an esa so does have some legal rights and isn't ""just a pet"". Even a service animal can't go into a private house, duh, everyone knows that. That's why I said she totally missed my point. But whoever that person is that says a service animal CAN'T is an asshole which is why I think she is the asshole.",1

"WIBTA for graverobbing our family pet? | Our dog passed three days ago. She predated my daughter and even my wife, so it was especially hard on me. We had a little burial in our backyard where my daughter (8) said a few words. We put her favorite blanket, and toy in the coffin I made and I buried her.

But, unbeknownst to me, my daughter snuck in another toy. I had a stuffed penguin I've had for nearly 15 years, it was something I bought for my previous dog before she passed, and this new dog played with it a lot, too. I wanted to keep this toy forever because it represented two dogs I've owned, not just the one. I kept it on my home office desk and had no intention of ever getting rid of it.

I guess my daughter thought it should be with her too, so she took it, put it in the coffin, and I buried it. I only found out today after asking her where the penguin went. Obviously I'm not going to get mad at her for this, but this cut deep. No fault of her own, she didn't know, but I'm left with a hard decision.

I think tonight when everyone's asleep, I'm going to dig up the coffin, pry it open, get the penguin back, and then rebury the coffin. I made mention of this to my wife, as a joke to gauge her reaction, and she said it was a dark joke and no sane person would do that. I might have to do it and never tell her or anyone else.

Would I be the asshole for graverobbing our family pet to retrieve this stuffed penguin?

"AITA for not wanting to get a job right now? | My parents want me to get a job. I completely get that, no problem. The problem is, I currently feel like it'll completely overwhelm my schedule. 
I'm a homeschooled senior, but I still have an online full-time course load, with band practice, gym, and flying lessons (which I'm pursuing as a career) on top of that, and I really don't have any free time during the week. From their point of view, they see me on my computer for 6-8 hours a day, and associate it with me goofing off/gaming. Because of this, they've always piled my schedule up with a ton of extracurricular activities, which made me absolutely miserable. (This contributed to a hospitalization for personal reasons in 2015, when I was 15.) 

This year, I managed to get rid of some of the extracurricular activities, with the main one being tennis, which was around 10 hours a week. While this has helped a ton with my mental health and my grades, my parents aren't too happy about it, and they've told me that because of this, they want me to get a job. Now, I have absolutely nothing against getting a job. I've worked a summer job at a restaurant for the past 4 years, so the idea of me getting a job/working isn't one I'm worried about. The problem I'm having is that they want me to get one right now, just to completely fill me schedule. 

They know that I am going to be working full time this summer, and that I want to get said job. I've tried talking to them about letting me finish up school, which are going to be wrapping up in 3 months, but they constantly say that my schedule needs to be completely filled. They constantly talk about how they when they were younger, they had both school and jobs, and they were completely fine, but from my point of view, I'm not them, and I can't really tolerate that kind of 24/7 schedule.

Over the past week, we've been fighting a lot over this. Anytime I try and talk to them about it, they pretend to be understanding, but then completely ignore anything I'm saying, and our conversations go nowhere. They constantly say that if I don't get a job, they're going to kick me out, (I'm 18, they can.), which will prevent me from going to college this fall due to being homeschooled. 

Honestly, I don't know what to think about either myself or my parents anymore, and I feel like there's nothing I can do. The only thing I want to do is finish up my school before I put anything else on my plate.

"AITA for freaking out at everyone and making them leave my house after I told them no fireworks? | Tonight I threw a party at my house for New Years Eve. I invited all my friends over, but I told everyone absolutely no fireworks. Fireworks trigger my ptsd from the military, I won‚Äôt go into detail but it brings back horrible memories of a mortar attack and stresses me out. I was in the kitchen drinking beer and they started setting off fireworks in my yard.

They eventually left after the argument. My blood is boiling now, I probably wont sleep tonight either. My wife said I over reacted by making everyone leave.

I have brought this up to him many times and he just doesn‚Äôt want to hear it anymore. He will not say anything to them especially his grandmother. My sons father did not receive used things growing up. They pretty much gave him a brand new house recently. The rest of the grandchildren in the family are a lot older and they receive large checks on Christmas and birthdays just like the rest of the adults. I have seen other people in the past get used things but they are always antiques or hard to find things that were requested. I believe that these people are somewhat frugal in day to day life but nothing to crazy. They live in a very nice home but have basic cars. They do a lot of traveling. I would say at least 8 vacations a year.",0
"AITA for being mad someone threw a diaper next to me? | Edit: threw OUT* a diaper beside my head

Throwaway simply because I don't want people digging through my history to use things against me.

Trying to be as objective as possible.



So I'm having lunch with some friends at a park yesterday and nearby us theres a family having a picnic with their baby. We're minding our own business and them theres. Suddenly one of the parents comes over to the bench where we're sitting and throws out a diaper in the garage can near where I'm sitting, a couple feet away. I see them approaching with the diaper and pause to watch and sure enough they threw it right out next to me. All I do is interrupt what I had been saying to my friend and say ""Thats disgusting are you kidding me?"". Didnt expect anyone to care.


Suddenly the parent stops and says ""sorry were you talking to me?"" I didn't want to get into it but literally seeing a shitty diaper thrown out just a few feet from my head and sandwich made my lunch feel rotten in my mouth so I said casually ""I just think you didn't need to throw out a shitty diaper right next to my head"". The parent rolls their eyes and said ""it wasnt even poop so you'll be okay"". I say that's not true because I can smell shit but theyre already walking away shaking their head and I can see them go sit back with the other parent and obviously tells them what happened because I see them look over with an audible ""seriously dude?"" now everyone is looking at me and my friends are telling me to drop it. I say I guess no one cares that my lunch is ruined because we're all siding with the parents here.


The parents dont say anything else to me and my friends tell me to drop it but I'm pissed that my lunch is ruined so I throw the rest of it out. 

I might be the asshole here. As we leave I was still mad so when we pass the park I say something like ""I guess we all have to cater to people with babies now"". One of the parents goes ""seriously?"" again as we pass and my friend apologies to them and tells me to drop it. I don't say anything else.


My side is that I should be able to eat my lunch in public without someone tossing out shit right beside me. Families have the right to public spaces too but so do regular people. They could have just as easily bagged the diaper up and thrown it out in a bathroom or somewhere more appropriate. 


I made a joke about it as we go to lunch today that hopefully I can eat this time without shit sitting next to me and my friend told me again that I need to get over it and that they said it wasnt even poop but I'm not going to sift through the garbage to find it and prove myself right. I believe I'm in the right to expect some courtesy in a public space but my friends told me to shut up about it. So go ahead and give me a fair judgement - AITA?

"WIBTA if I don‚Äôt go to the wedding I RSVPd for because I got free tickets to a baseball game | So, my husband‚Äôs good friend from high school (who we haven‚Äôt really seen in like two years) is getting married in two weeks. They sent us a save the date months ago and it‚Äôs been on our fridge since. They sent an invitation with a paid postage RSVP letter in it. We RSVPd with full intentions of going. This is going to be a high budget, fancy wedding. 

Anyway, so my SIL offered us free tickets to a Padres game (they are great seats, like right behind home plate). Obviously we jumped at the opportunity to go, we aren‚Äôt Padres fans, but we both like sports and going to sporting events. San Diego is only a 4 hour drive and so we planned a nice little weekend getaway so that we could spend some much needed time together (work has been busy, family has been in town, we haven‚Äôt had much alone time).

A week ago, my sister was over and noticed the save the date on the fridge and asked if we were going to the wedding. We said yes, then she mentioned that it was the same day as our planned trip... 

My husband was like ‚Äúwell, they didn‚Äôt come to our wedding...‚Äù but I brought up that ours wasn‚Äôt a fancy, big, RSVP-worthy wedding. AND they didn‚Äôt say they were going to come and then just not show up... we really want to go to the baseball game. Either way, we are going to get them a gift which is the main point of a wedding... right? Are we the assholes for not wanting to go to his friend‚Äôs wedding that we RSVPd for...?

Edit: It occurs to me that my definition of a ‚Äúbig, fancy wedding‚Äù may be different than others... my husband and I spent maybe $7,000 on our entire wedding including my dress, the photographer, food, etc. And it was exactly what we wanted. I guess when I say ‚Äúbig, fancy wedding‚Äù I mean more like $15,000-30,000. Not like upwards of $100,000 where they‚Äôd be spending over $100 a plate.

Edit: My husband ultimately decided he‚Äôd rather go to the Padres game. We turned it into a family trip and invited my mom, dad, brother, sister, niece and nephew. We stayed with my uncle, so didn‚Äôt have to pay for a hotel and only ate out a couple of times. It ended up not being too expensive of a trip and we all had a great time. It was a nice, relaxing weekend away. Thanks for all the comments! Love, Assholes.",1

"AITA Backing Out of Oldest Friends Wedding | AITA or more of, WIBEA (Would I be...)

**Edit** Thank you everyone for your comments. You have helped make a difficult decision at least a bit easier. Also thanks for the input about having a conversation about how to make it work  more than just telling him I can't. Not used to talking finances with friends so that obvious answer didn't even strike me. Thank you again!

About 3 months ago I accepted the honor of being one of the groomsmen in one of my oldest friends wedding (the wedding is in October). I live internationally, and at the time I knew that attending his wedding would be expensive. However, at the time I did not research all the costs, and as I am looking to book a hotel + plane tickets + car rental + rental tux (+ missed days of school), the reality of the total cost is hitting home (around $2,300-$2,600). In addition, I would be missing a week of school, and have to show up to the rehearsal dinner, go the wedding, and then leave the next morning. So all of this probably 60-72 hours total in country.

The more I stare at these costs, the more I want to apologize and back out. However, he is one of my oldest friends who I care deeply about, and I don't want to be a total jerk or ruin our friendship. So this is a bit forward looking rather than rear looking, but if I were to back out of the wedding, would I be an asshole?

"AITA My husband's cat is vomiting everywhere and I want to have him put down | AITA My husband had this cat long before we met.  Been married almost 10 years, the cat is 15. The cat has got some sort of stomach issue where he vomits constantly.  Today he vomited on our bed, and I'm fairly sure he urinated on it (cant prove it was him but it had to have been some animal,  we have a few). I'm sick of it and I want to have the cat put to sleep.  Am I the asshole here?

"AITA for giving Bibles as gifts? | I'm a christian and proud of it. This year at Christmas my friends and I all discussed gifts and decided that the gift we give each other should have a special and deep meaning. Some of my friends painted things, or knit things, wrote poems or stories, bought a movie or book or CD that meant something to each person.

My relationship with the Lord is special and personal to me. I spent my free time reading Bible verses and finding verses that applied to each of my friends and wrote it in the front cover of their bible, along with a personal message just telling them why I chose it, why I feel like it spoke to me in regards to them, thanked them for being in my life. I had each of the bibles monogrammed. They're gorgeous bibles, burgundy bound with gold inscription and buttery-soft pages.

I'm not trying to convert anyone, they can throw the Bible in a box in their attics if they want. But my religion is special to me and in keeping with the theme of our gifts I felt like it was suitable. As for me  from my friends I received a beautiful set of crocheted dish towels, a poem, a beautiful photo frame with the first photo of myself and that friend, a pair of hand-made socks, and one of those Mason Jars with the pasta and the spices and the sauce recipe, respectively from each of my friends. I love each present.

But when my friends opened their bibles I saw obvious disappointment and even disdain on their faces. They aren't atheists or anything, most of friends have a wide variety of beliefs and consider themselves spiritual and agnostic. We have religious-based discussions all the time but I make sure I never, ever shove my beliefs down their throats. I support LGBTQ rights and am Pro-life (this is supposed to be choice not life, I mistyped due to distraction, not that anyone will believe me.)

"AITA for asking my friend to make out while we were both drunk? | This happened a few nights ago. We were both chilling at a friends house and there was alcohol involved. After a fun night we were winding down and getting ready to go to bed. Lo and behold, we were sharing a bed for some reason.

Then my dumbass drunk self wanted to make out with them

I asked, but there was no reply, so I assumed they fell asleep so I continued asking. this went on for like ten minutes. eventually I assumed they were way to asleep to wake her, so I went to bed. To be clear, I never actually did anything. I didn't touch them or try to kiss them in any way. In the morning I apologized to them a bunch and I felt pretty bad.

Yesterday they messaged me and told me that they didn't want to hang out with me or be friends anymore. I'm still really mad at myself and completely regret everything I did, but was their reaction justified?

"AITA for ending a friendship over cameras? | So I moved in with a friend 10months back and a few months in I installed a ring doorbell on the front door. I didn't ask him if it was ok because it provides security and shows me when my packages are being delivered. It even records audio and video for 60 days which is awesome too. I offered he could pay for it to gain access and he denied and said he didn't like being recorded. He didn't fight it too much and so everything moved on. 

Fast forward a month and ring doorbells are on sale again so I go ahead and get one for the back door so now theres security watching the garage. This starts a big fight because my friend feels like he is being spied on due to the camera alerting me anytime he comes home, goes in the garage, hangs outside with friends, etc. One day hes telling me about how much he had to leave the house that day being busy and I jokingly say I know my phone was blowing up with video. Yes it was true but I was just joking. The next day he gets mad and about being watched and hits the doorbell when he leaves the house and puts a post it on the camera to block my view. 

Now I get mad and I threaten to take away everything I own in the house if he doesn't stop fucking with my camera. We talk about it for an hour or so and he backs down. Now months later he is still against the cameras and wants to talk about it saying he wants even treatment and friendship. I'm not going to talk to him. My opinion on this is firm and if we need to end this friendship because he doesn't like me installing security he can move out in a few months. AITA?

"AITA for lying to my ex-gf when I got my tax return because she wanted half? | Edit: I gave her $2400 out of $2471 in my bank account on Venmo before I made this post. 

Let it rain on me. Everyone else fucking has today. 

I claimed my exgfs two children and our newborn for 2018. 

She wanted half of my return, and then cheated on me/moved in with pill addict mom+dad. 

I got my return around March 15. I waited until now to get a new car and show up to her house in it. 

I spent my tax return on this new car, paid my debt off including debt she accrued on CareCredit, loaned my coworker $450 I‚Äôll see next Friday, and paid my April rent. 

I also have spent 500-600 on weed. I want to say 400-500 but trying to be realistic. 


So I show up to her moms house to see the kids and her. We were on good terms. About to spend the day together. I tell her I have a surprise and show her the new car. 

She asked where her portion was, which I told her I could only give her $1500-2000. I told her all that I spent it on besides the loan+weed. I‚Äôm sure she will put two and two together regarding the weed even if I didn‚Äôt tell her. 

Anyways. Her mom busts out of her room and tells me I owe her money for her van she let us use while we had our newborn. I guess my ex is going to buy it for $800. 

Everyone is yelling at me, ex starts yelling at mom to go in her room. Mom refuses. Eyes are popping out while she‚Äôs swearing and yelling at me. All this is happening in front of our baby and 2/4 year olds. 

I stayed calm but broke everyone‚Äôs heart and saw their true colors today. Her mom doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about me besides my money.

"AITA for collaborating on a gift for my wife with my ex? | TL;DR at the bottom. 


My wife and I have been married for less than a year. I thought it would be a nice early Christmas gift to get her a nice dress and take her out to a fancy place for dinner and to a lounge where we could dance and hear some good music. 
I don‚Äôt know much about clothes, but I started looking for dresses from designers back in October. I would find things that I thought she would like but they would be in the wrong color, or they would have some detail about them that I knew that she wouldn‚Äôt like. 
After looking at dresses for a while I had a good idea about what I wanted to buy, but I couldn‚Äôt find it.

 I have an ex that makes clothes/does art. 
She‚Äôs pretty successful. We dated from the end of highschool (like 12th grade) until the end of college, so for a considerable amount of time. 
We were friends for three years or so after we broke up. My wife was uncomfortable with our friendship while we were dating, so we aren‚Äôt very close anymore. I still go to group events/birthday parties with her there. 

I went to my ex and asked her if she knew where I could find something similar to what I wanted or if she could make it for me. After we talked for a while, she agreed to hook me up and make it for me if I found the fabric. This was back in October. She finished the dress about a week ago, and I presented it to my wife yesterday. Our dinner was supposed to be this evening. 
The dress is hand made, hand dyed and hand beaded. It looks exactly how *I* wanted it to look. She loved the dress when she opened it and about cried. When she went to try it on she saw my ex‚Äôs very recognizable last name on the tag. She flipped it and threw the dress at me, and started talking about how I don‚Äôt respect her. She started crying and asking if I was cheating on her with my ex. She was just generally very defensive and upset. 

I told her that I was very offended that she would behave like that, and tried to explain to her all of the work that my ex did to make this dress to help me out and make her happy. She‚Äôs not hearing it. She is still refusing to talk to me. I‚Äôm new at this, so I‚Äôm honestly wondering if what I did was that egregious. From my perspective my ex is just another clothes designer. I paid her for the work she did (even though she discounted it), and got a custom dress done for my wife.

TLDR: I got my ex that designs clothes to make a custom dress for my wife. She is very upset and refuses to talk to me, AITA?",1

"AITA for ‚Äòlaughing‚Äô at an incident in which my friend‚Äôs friend was humiliated? | I‚Äôll try and keep this short

My friend told me (via text) her male friend who wears flamboyant clothes and makeup was told by a bouncer at a club that he ‚Äòwasn‚Äôt a man‚Äô and needed to join the female line to be searched.

I, finding the situation ridiculous, said ‚ÄúHow does one get told they‚Äôre not a man hahahah‚Äù to which my friend seemed to get quite upset, telling me it wasn‚Äôt funny and that it must have been a humiliating and dehumanising experience. 

I try to explain that I agree; I‚Äôm laughing at the situation and how stupid it is, not laughing at the person. My friend doesn‚Äôt seem to care.

I‚Äôm torn between just apologising, or standing my ground as I meant no offence, the opposite actually. I‚Äôd like some neutral opinions to help my decision. AITA?

"AITA for Not wanting to go to Wife's Childhood Friends wedding? | I was discussing the upcoming year last night with my wife and the subject of her childhood friends wedding came up, the conversation started something like this (these aren't exact words and I may not be conveying this perfectly, so bear with me):

Her: ""we don't have much travel next year, except for my friends wedding""

Me: ""I didn't think I was going to that, and I don't want to go, do I need to go?""

Her: ""Yes, she's family""

Me: ""No she's not""

Her: ""She's like family to me, and you need to come""

Me: ""I really don't want to, I don't know her that well, and every time I'm here for things like this I'm basically assigned to watch the kids (love my kids, but they can be a handful) while everyone else has a great time""

The conversation then proceeded to get into a full blown argument where she said she came to all of my family's weddings and I pointed out she hasn't come to any of my very close friends' weddings. Basically her argument hinges on her friend being family, which is hard for me to understand given she clearly didn't care to come to my friends weddings (to be fair, I didn't really care if she came as it's not someone important to her and told her so, and she probably would have come if I had insisted, but she clearly didn't want to).

A bit of background information: I come from a large family (7 siblings including me) while she comes from a 2 child household. The friend in question grew up on the same block as my wife and they played together most days until around 8-10 ish (could be way off on the years, but the friends family moved away before the end of high school). They've stayed in contact since then, but mostly see each other around once a year.

Relevant information:

The last time our families got together I was stuck watching my screaming children in another room for 3-4 hours while listening to loud laughter floating in from the other room. I don't want a repeat of that

The wedding will be in another state, and I don't want to pay \~$1,200 to fly 3 extra people up to a wedding that has no real importance to anyone but my wife. I'd much rather stay home with the kids and have fun there.

"WIBTA if I tell my sister her daughter is going to become a stripper? | My sister and her husband have two daughters. 8 months who I'll call B and a 5 year old who I'll call A. 

My sister and her husband are both amazing parents. They really are. But they've gotten into the habit of referring to their youngest as the dumb one (pretty sure it was started by my sister who has a tendency to take little things she finds funny a bit too far). It's not a constant thing but they've definitely made enough comments that the immediate family has noticed.  

A has always been pretty smart and advanced for her age. Like they're already talking about maybe skipping a grade. The baby will do stupid baby stuff (try to eat stuff she shouldn't, get stuck between stuff while crawling around, get confused by something) and they'll both kind of laugh and roll their eyes. Sometimes they'll say something like ""Oh B, at least you're pretty!"" or ""Yeah doesn't look like B is gonna be the sharpest tool in the shed...""

I 100% think that they mean nothing by this and don't even realize what they're doing but I know that I need to bring it up so they notice and stop.

We're not really ones to be blunt open in my family so I figured the best way to bring it up would be an ""offhand"" joke. Like my sister says something to B like ""You might not be that smart but that's okay!"" and then I lightly say something along the lines of ""B, you tell mommy that if she keeps talking like that she's gonna kill your self esteem and you're gonna end up on a stripper pole lol""

I honestly think it's the easiest way to point out how they're being but my parents are telling me that telling my sister her baby is gonna become a stripper is weird and gross. 

WIBTA if I go ahead with my plan?


UPDATE: Thank you all so much for your advice 

I was hanging out with my sister tonight which is why I made the post. I had decided to not day anything unless the subject came up and of course it did. 

My sister made a comment about B trying to crawl inti a cabinet and not realizing she was too big HAHAHHAHA *eye roll*

I avoided the ""stripper"" comment but kept with the light, jokey vibe and was like ""oh poor B. You guys are gonna kill her self esteem if you keep calling her stupid.""

Sister said that they have NEVER actually called her stupid. Which got a blank stare from me cuz come on. You know what you're doing. 

She said it was just fun because B can be silly and chill while A never was and was always so serious. Met with another blank stare cuz cmon. Calling your baby silly and saying 'welp. At least Cs get degrees!!"" are two very different things. 

We transitioned into a different subject and I was kind of surprised with how quickly she blew it over but I blame it on her having a long day with the kiddos. She's the kind of person that worries over every little thing so I assume this will hit her and churn until she knocks it off. If not, I guess I'll bring it up again and just be more direct.",1
"AITA for asking my mum to replace the $150 she got confiscated by police? | Just a bit of background: I'm 19F living with my partner 22M. We rent out the garage in my mother's house. I buy my own groceries, I have my own DIY kitchen. I stay to my room and only venture out to the rest of the house to see my mother and siblings or go to the bathroom. 

The other morning I got woken up to loud banging on my door, like really fucking loud. I knew right away it was police as throughout my childhood my house had been raided quite a few times due to my mothers actions. I'm not gonna get specific about what she did/is currently doing, mostly because I try to know as little as possible. 

I freaked out because I was butt-naked and they were about to come in any minute. I jumped up and got dressed as fast as I could while my boyfriend tried his best to hide our bong and stash. Not well considering he only had 10-15 seconds. We get pushed out of our rooms and told we are being detained. At this point it's me, my boyfriend, my mum and my sister sitting on the couch in the loungeroom at about 8:30am surrounded by 6 cops. I'm annoyed as all hell because as per usual I'm dragged into whatever my mum has done. After the police do the standard procedures (stating why they're there, showing us proof of the warrant etc.) They ask my boyfriend to come up to our room while they search. They flat out ask him if they're gonna find anything. Knowing that everything wasn't hidden very well and it wouldn't take police long to find it, he told them what they might find. 

Naturally they confiscated our bong, weed (about a q), scissors, pretty much anything to do with pot. Because my boyfriend was honest about it and cooperated with the police they gave him a slap on the wrist and told him he had to go to a drug diversion class. Obviously they found jackshit when it came to mum (the actual reason they were there). Now at this point we're kind of annoyed. I call her later that day, in the afternoon while I'm out. I mentioned that my boyfriend and I were gonna take $150 out of the $370 rent we owe. She kind of chuckled and asked why we didn't hide it well. I explained to her that I was completely nude and was focusing my efforts on not being nude. 

The next day I went into my mothers room just to double check with her she knew I was serious about the rent thing. She told me that she wasn't willing to do that because it was our fault we got caught cause we didn't hide it well enough. She also added that a few people had mentioned that I was being unreasonable and that mum was being a pushover. We fought for a bit until she told to me to shut the fuck up so I walked away. Now all I'm wondering is am I being unreasonable? Should I just pay in full and move on?

EDIT: A lot of people mentioned that I should be used to police raids by now. That's my fault for not being clear enough. I said it was a common occurrence throughout my childhood. I had moved out of home with my boyfriend and then when his lease ran up, we decided to sign a lease with my mum. Before we did anything I told her that I was feeling uneasy about moving in with her due to past things like raids and abusive boyfriends. She promised me things would be different and that she was gonna stop doing whatever she does. Obviously that wasn't true.",1

"AITA for wanting to return an expensive engagement ring? | My boyfriend (48m) recently proposed to me (40f). We'd been talking about getting engaged for a while, and he wanted me to pick the ""ring of my dreams."" I told him from the beginning I didn't care what the ring cost and that I would be happy with a simple band. He insisted he wanted to get me something truly incredible. In the end, he spent around 12K on the ring. I offered to pay half; he refused. I tried to get a smaller center diamond; he thought the larger looked better in the setting. (Just to clarify, we both make good money, and while he's not crazy rich, spending 12K on the ring didn't bankrupt him either.)

Fast forward a few weeks: a few times now, he's reminded me of how much he spent on the ring, like, ""What do you have to complain about? I just spent 12K on your ring"" or ""I'm not the one wearing a 12K ring."" I'm tired of it and feel like the ring is a noose around my neck. This morning I told him I wanted him to return the ring (it's still within the 90 day return window), and I could wear a small band instead. I told him I didn't want the price of the ring constantly thrown in my face. He completely lost it and told me I was being ungrateful and the ring was a symbol of his love. I think it's manipulative to mention the price of the ring after he's given it to me when I never pushed for an expensive ring. AITA here?",0

"AITA for not wanting to sign a move out agreement? | So happened back in February, I had been living with my roommate for just over a year when the opportunity came for me to purchase my own apartment! At the time I had been working 4 hours away only coming home on weekends. I gave my roommate two months notice of my plan to move out as well as the landlord. (My name was on the lease and not hers). That's when things went south everything was fine until then. She then began to dictate how I moved out. I explained I could only be home on weekends to move and do what I could with that time. She then decided to write up an ""agreement"" demanding her terms of what needed to be done when I moved. Cleaning, belongings, bills sorted etc. But she had it written if I did not comply she would have full control of my possisions and safety deposit. (Which should have been the landlords decision) So I didn't feel comfortably signing especially with the wording. But also knowing it had no legal weight behind it. A document she wrote up and printed. I still didn't want to take the chance of it coming back on me later. So now she is being super aggressive and holding my late mail hostage, since I didn't comply with signing. AITA?

Not sure if doing this correct 

Update: 
Also takes place in Canada
So this took place at the end of February I have already been moved out for a month. (I moved to take care of my mothers estates as she went to a home)  I also recieved my damage deposit. I have no want to get the authorities involved as we run in the same friends circle and hoping she will come to her senses. She is currently using Covid as her excuse for her not allowing me accees to my mail. When I requested to pick up my mail she was very belligerent toward me so I saved the convo. As for the agreement at the time many people told me to suck it up and sign just to GTFO, but wanted a mutual friend to witness instead she got her boyfriend so I didn't agree. In the end just to keep her from screaming at me I signed as a left with all my possessions no witnesses, no one home just to gain some peace and get my deposit. The landlord also switch her name onto the lease mid February even though I had paid till the end of the month. They were the slumlords of my town so didn't care as long as they got rent.

The saddest part is we adopted cats together which we shared costs of, I expressed interest in taking them with me once settled but she had ""conditions"" I had to meet. She has since belittled me/lied about me to make it look like I am unfit/incapable, when really just her manipulation and venting. This I left out as felt not important to original post.

"AITA for having my GF sleep in the car | I (35m) Went to NYE concert with gf (21) and two friends, Tom (35m) and Sue (24f). We‚Äôve been planning to go for months. Gf forgets to ask off work and tells them she won‚Äôt be back in time for her shift but will come in late (important later).

On the night before the concert gf says she doesn‚Äôt feel well. I tell her she doesnt have to go. She confirms she still wants to go with Tom and sue, but is a little upset when she finds out we are not riding separately from Tom and Sue, but in fact are riding all together. 

On New Year‚Äôs Eve, we travel to Tom and sue, we stop for breakfast and medicine because GF says she isn‚Äôt feeling well. 

We travel 5 hours with Tom and Sue and GF sleeps on my lap most of the way. During our travel we make plans to eat breakfast at a diner on New Years morning. 

Arrive at Airbnb GF seems fine, but says she doesn‚Äôt feel great. We have a conversation about how we will not make it back in time for her to go to work at all. I tell her she doesn‚Äôt have to go to the concert and it‚Äôs ok to stay at Airbnb and rest. She says she wants to go. At concert in line she seems fine. 

At the concert she says she feels even more sick, sleeps through concert. Clearly meds wearing off. I make sure she has water and coats to pillow up. GF Goes out to car to sleep until the concert is over. I offer to get her food afterwards she doesn‚Äôt want. I make sure she has water medicine and extra blankets.

New Years morning we get ready to go and I carry out our things and pack the car and GF wants me to ask Tom and Sue not to go to breakfast. I tell her no and we go to breakfast and let her sleep In the car while we eat, because she doesn‚Äôt want to eat with us. about 40-45 minutes. 

She is pissed at all three of us doesn‚Äôt say a word the entire 5 hr trip home. Sleeps much of the way on my lap, I still offer food water whatever she needs to take care of her. 

We get home and she tells me she‚Äôs mad at me for making her sleep in the car instead of asking Tom and sue to go through a fast food. I was not angry until this moment. I tell her I don‚Äôt believe she was as sick as she was acting and she just wanted to make herself feel better about missing work, and have a reason to be anti social.

"AITA for yelling at my dad for telling me something that I think was insensitive? | My 96 year old grandmother was admitted into the ER yesterday with congestive heart failure. She has always been healthy, sharp as a tack and one of the strongest women I know - even after losing her only daughter (my mom). The bond that I share with her is so deep. When I walk into her home, I can feel my mother's presence (okay, not in a paranormal way)....but the way her house smells, when I hear her voice, when I see her face.....everything brings warmth and comfort into my heart.

My father told me that she had been admitted to the ER for congestive heart failure and I immediately started crying. Any time I hear of a close loved one being sick I go into somewhat of a panic mode because it triggers the memory of receiving ""that"" phone call that my mother was dead.

My father became annoyed with me. He told me, ""Why do you always react this way? I shouldn't have even told you. She's NINETY SIX! You should prepare yourself!"" My father and I NEVER argue. He is the love of my life but when he said this, my body stiffened up and I yelled, ""How can you say that? It's like if someone were to come and tell me, 'Your dad is 75, you should be prepared because he's old! She is healthy and can do things that 96 years old can't do! SHE DOESN'T WANT TO DIE so how in the hell can you expect me to ""prepare myself"" to watch my grandmother die when SHE DOESN'T WANT TO DIE????"" My father just gave me a look - I'm not sure if he felt bad for raising his voice at me or if he was surprised that I raised my voice at him - gave me kiss and then left my house.

I've been feeling so conflicted. I love and respect my dad and I NEVER yell at him. But, I think his delivery was a bit insensitive.

In the end he pays but the issue is EVERYTIME we go out he asks if I will pay for it and obviously I can‚Äôt so I get frustrated. he asked me to go with him and pay even though he knows my financial situation(I usually try to say I can‚Äôt go but that only makes him upset). In reality I only get about 100 to spend for 2 weeks and the rest goes to savings. so I really have to budget everything in and end up using every cent towards other expenses and groceries. I know I could put less in savings but I need a car in less than 3 weeks. I‚Äôm really scrambling for money because I do not have a credit score so I can‚Äôt get a loan. I told him if he wants me to go out with him he‚Äôs going to have to pay until I get everything settled. He seemed fine with it until we go out again and he asks me the same thing while we are at the restaurant. At this point I‚Äôm tired of it and just tell him I won‚Äôt be going out to eat with him. Then he blames me saying I just don‚Äôt know how to spend my money correctly and it doesn‚Äôt cost a lot to eat out. I lashed out and I told him I have to save every cent and I cannot do everything he can because my parents don‚Äôt help me financially like his does. He got upset and isn‚Äôt talking to me at the moment.,0
"AITA for wanting to move somewhere I can‚Äôt afford but my bf can? | Throwaway in case anyone recognizes our situation. 

My boyfriend and I of 3 years are finally moving in together. We live in a really, really expensive city where rent can be exorbitant. I currently live in a smaller flat with 3 roommates and my bf lives close to the city center in a small flat he bought 2 years ago. 

We‚Äôve decided that we‚Äôll look for a new, larger place that‚Äôs just ‚Äúours‚Äù and my bf will sell his flat or rent it out (he hasn‚Äôt decided yet.) 

So right now we‚Äôre looking around but we can‚Äôt decide on a budget. For one, he earns 7x what I do (45k vs. ~300k) and can afford so much more in rent. I want to look at larger places that are far out of my price range ($800-1000) but he could easily afford ($4000-5000) because these are the only ones that are close to both of our work and large enough to live in comfortably with two people. However, he wants to look at cheaper flats that A) are affordable to me and B) would allow him to pay roughly the same as me. 

We had a fight recently where I said I‚Äôd like to look at more expensive flats and he asked me how I‚Äôd afford my share (he thinks I should pay 35-40% of rent). I said I‚Äôd like to pay what I‚Äôm paying now ($750) and he could make up the rest. He got upset at me even though it would still be a smaller share of his income. I feel guilty to asking him to pay more but I feel upset that he‚Äôd rather live in a smaller, shittier flat just so I ‚Äúpay my equal share‚Äù than spend more so we could both be comfortable. AITA for the suggestion?

**edit:** sorry I got the math wrong, he wants me to contribute 35-40% not 25-30%. So our budget would be $2200 a month if I contribute the same as before ($750). This cost is essentially nothing to him though but I feel like he‚Äôs sticking to it for the principle which makes me feel really shitty.",1
"AITA for ruining my family‚Äôs movie by vaping in the theater? | I recently quit smoking before going home for the holidays. While staying with my family in a small rural city, I went to see the new big box office hit at our local theater with my mom and aunt. Not really my bag, but hey the seats reclined and they served  beer so why not. 
With about 10 minutes left in the movie the guy next to me says loudly ‚ÄúARE YOU VAPING? SERIOUSLY?!‚Äù Sure enough, my [insert name brand small vaping device] was in my hand. I didn‚Äôt realize how automatic the habit had become, plus I was completely engrossed in the last minutes of the film. So I said, ‚Äúmy bad dude, I won‚Äôt do it again,‚Äù and put it away.
He kept saying thinks like ‚Äúthis is bullshit‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in that thing‚Äù and ‚Äúmy KIDS are here‚Äù LOUDLY. So I packed my things, got up, and said to my family ‚Äúyou guys stay and enjoy the rest of the film.‚Äù
The guy FOLLOWED me out and told a manager that he noted our seat numbers and that I should be ARRESTED. He was at least 6‚Äô I‚Äôm a small-ish 5‚Äô7‚Äù girl, so it was a bit scary. My mom also came out and the manager came out and asked me to leave. Which is fine, I fucked up. I asked her if my family could stay and finish the film, but at this point the guy was still yelling that his ‚Äúkids are here‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in that thing.‚Äù So we all left.
My mom yelled at me as soon as we got back and my aunt is furious with me. I was emotionally exhausted by being yelled at by a stranger and my family, so I retreated to the guest room for the rest of the night. Tonight is my last night home and I feel bad for not spending more time with my mom, but honestly I don‚Äôt have anymore mental energy. Am I the asshole here?",1

"AITA for sleeping with someone else's wife and possibly breaking up a family | Before you hit me with YTA, hear me out. I met a woman at one of my local college bars. She was super cool and we hit it off pretty well. Turns out she was a semi recent graduate and was there as a recruiter for a business. It later came up that she was married and had a kid of like 2 or 3. She used this opportunity to bitch about her husband not taking care of the kid and other stuff (but that's not important). She ended up trying to come over to my place but since we were both kinda drunk I thought that could end badly, so I gave her my number and told her to call me tomorrow if she felt the same way. I made up a bullshit excuse about having to get up early the next day or something. Obviously as the title implies, she ended up coming over. Now some of my friends have really been upset over this stating they've ""lost some respect for me"" and called me a ""massive asshole/home wrecker"". Now in my defence I figured that since I'm single and not committed to anyone than I'm personally not cheating, nor is it my job to police her relationship. Plus if she's willing to cheat on her husband with me than she's probably willing to cheat on him with someone else and I'm not the only thing between them and happiness. AITA?

Edit: To all the people saying ""get tested she's probably done this before"". Doesn't that mean I'm not the asshole? This is gonna make reddit hate me but like put yourself in my shoes. On one hand, I get laid on the other hand I don't but either way she still cheats, thus aren't I at least neutral party in this situation. I mean she's a consenting adult, who did I hurt, nobody. She's the one who hurt her family. I don't even know them.

Last edit: For final clarification. I have no intentions of having a relationship with this woman. Though reddit may disagree I'm not stupid.",1

"AITA for requesting rules and rent in order for my brother in law to live with us? | He‚Äôs an alcoholic, drug user and in and out of jobs and has multiple DUIS, been evicted from multiple apartments and has no regard for anyone‚Äôs feelings or belongings. He recently went to rehab out of state and completed a 90 day program. He‚Äôs 23 years old and this is the 3rd time he‚Äôs been to rehab. My father was an addict. He lost his life too it. So I understand that addiction is hard to deal with. While I do sympathize for my BIL when it comes to those issues he continues to make poor decision after poor decision.  My wife and my BIL grew up very well off. My in-laws are loaded. They wanted for nothing. Had a great home life and were set up for success. My BIL is that typical ‚Äúdaddy‚Äôs money will save me rich kid.‚Äù My wife is a lot more humble. I came from nothing and had a single mother who raised 6 kids. My BIL used to be able to get away with anything when he was younger but now that he‚Äôs been a complete fuck up his whole adult life my in-laws have basically written him off. (More so my father in law) He‚Äôs crashed cars that they leased for him, he‚Äôs a compulsive liar, he worked for a family member of mine and showed up to work drunk and got a DUI in company vehicle, I could go on for days sadly.  Since my BIL got back from rehab he has held a job and moved into a sober house. It‚Äôs been two months and we haven‚Äôt heard much from him. Usually when he needs something he will go to my MIL because he has his mom in his back pocket still. He burnt his borrow bridge with wife and I. A few days ago my MIL called my wife and I guess my BIL has to be out of his room in 7 days. No one knows why but my FIL and myself think he‚Äôs using again. My wife and I have two kids, we just bought a nice house recently and things are going very well with our lives. My MIL is begging us to let my BIL live with us temporarily. I refuse. My MIL says he has a job, will pay rent and it‚Äôs only temporary until he can find a place. But given his track record and the things I have in my house I don‚Äôt feel comfortable letting him live in my home. Also he doesn‚Äôt have a car and isn‚Äôt allowed to drive and we have 3 vehicles here. So I know very quickly we will turn into chauffeurs and it‚Äôs not happening. We have PLENTY of space in our house could easily accommodate him but again I refuse. I told my wife and MIL he has to pay $500 a month, can‚Äôt be out all hours of the night, has to buy all his own items including toiletries and food and I want him to drug tested if he is to stay with us. And he has 30 days to find a place to live. My MIL said I am an asshole and that those are ridiculous requests because that it‚Äôs family. I don‚Äôt want drugs or any other substances around my kids. I don‚Äôt want the chance of something going missing, I have nice things in my house. I dont think I‚Äôm an ass and neither does my FIL but my MIL is livid.

She then asks is it ok to drink it after it‚Äôs already been poured...I tell her that you‚Äôre supposed to ask to go into the fridge and pour it. Not pour it and then ask for permission to drink it.

"WIBTAH for telling a classmate that he creeps me out and to leave me alone? | Background: I (22f) wear a filtration mask most of the time when I'm out of the house due to severe allergies and iffy immune system, and sometimes use a cane due to a knee injury. I'm also a lesbian who is very much off the market and has been for four years. 

This semester in one of my classes this guy started talking to me, and at first I didn't think anything of it. He's visibly disabled and also a clear freshman. He kept striking up conversations on the first day of class (about two weeks ago) and wanting to know more about me, and then more, and then more, till it started weirding me out and one of my friends discreetly rescued me from the conversation. This went on for about a week, with me mostly ignoring him.

We accidentally wound up walking to class together last wednesday, and it really seemed like he was flirting with me. I shot him down at every chance I got but he did not get the message (said no to getting coffee, no to sharing notes, no to talking about my mask or cane, no to sitting together in class). He is now sitting next to me, staring at me and every time I answer a question he gives me this huge smile like he's extremely proud or something. He doesn't seem to talk to anyone else, including the professor. 

I'm conflicted. Maybe I'm misreading his signals and he's just an awkward neurodivergent guy who is gravitating to the only other visibly disabled person in the class, and I don't want to jump to conclusions and tell him to leave me alone if he doesn't mean anything by it. But also, I want this to stop. I've considered skipping this class just to get away from him. Would telling him to shove it make me an asshole?",0

"WIBTA if I took my sisters baby name | My sister (40) and me (31) to give some idea of our background we both have stable LTR partners. She  has been trying for three years and just recently failed IVF for the second time. I have had one which is now a 6 month old in that time which she is happy for but despite her never showing it might still be hard on her. My partner and I had a very hard time deciding on a name and unfortunately one of the few we mutually agreed on initially and that we still like she said in a conversation first before I told her. It‚Äôs from a game which myself and my partner like as well as her partner, which I‚Äôm guessing is is why we thought of it. I said absolutely not as she mentioned it first as I know how hurt I would be. So we picked something else which to be honest I wasn‚Äôt entirely happy with. It seems her chances are highly unlikely and she is not sure if she will try again, she only stated she would try twice but it seems she is leaning toward giving it another go.

"WIBTA if I (F25) only join Christmas dinner with my mother if there will be no alcohol? | I know it sounds bad, but I just really don't want my mom to drink any alcohol when I'm around. She isn't very good in holding her liquor.

As my parents are divorced and both me and my brother (M22) have moved out, we don't always celebrate Christmas with our mother. This year, we and our partners will all go to her place and celebrate with her and her boyfriend.

My biggest concern is that she will get drunk with Christmas and will be mean and/or agressive.

During the divorce with my dad, she once got so drunk, she threw my little brother and I (then 14) out of the house. My father picked us up and we stayed with him over the weekend. It really shook me. I don't feel we ever got a real apology for her drunk behaviour.A few years later, she even managed to get drunk at a New Years Eve party at a friends' place (me and my brother were there too) and be brought to bed even before it was midnight.

Every time we try to talk to her about her behaviour after a couple of drinks, she feels its nog our place. Or says we are overreacting. Often she just gets annoying and laughs at her own terrible (and sometimes hurtful) jokes.But I feel I just don't trust her. As normal talking does not help, would making demands make a difference?

It feels unkind to plain out say that I don't want her to drink when I'm around. So I feel like us all not drinking would be a better way. Or is there another way to fix this?",0

"AITA for handing someone tissues and implying they‚Äôre rude | I (25M) am a law student. Our library is divided into sections, with some designated as ‚Äúcollaborative study areas‚Äù where quiet discussion is allowed. This division suggests that discussion is not allowed, or at least strongly discouraged, elsewhere in the library. The result is that certain areas of the library, particularly the stacks, are dead quiet. 

Earlier today I was studying in the stacks when a fellow student, Sniffing Sally (20‚Äôs F) sat at the desk next to me. She immediately begins sniffling: every 45-60 seconds *sniiiif*. It was really irritating and impossible to ignore since the stacks are so quiet and I didn‚Äôt have headphones.  

I usually keep a travel pack of tissues in my book bag, and after about 5 minutes of continuous sniffing I grab the pack of tissues and put it on her desk. Sally looks up and asks what I‚Äôm doing. Wanting to keep the interaction as brief as possible, I say sniffing is rude and go back to my desk. She packs up her things and leaves.

"AITA for shaming my neighbor? | UPDATE: The neighbor who lives on new neighbor's block took a walk to confirm which recyclable bins were hers to tell the can collector which bins to avoid. He found the right house and a woman happened to be outside. He stopped to talk with her and learned that she was new neighbor's daughter-in-law. Turns out new neighbor is just staying for a couple of weeks to help her son and daughter-in-law get settled in their new house. She took it upon herself to come to the neighborhood meeting to air her grievances about the can collector, but she won't be living in the neighborhood at all. My neighbor said the daughter-in-law seemed very embarrassed about her mother-in-law's actions, and she assured him that she would be at the next neighborhood meeting to introduce herself and that she would definitely not give the can collector any trouble.

My neighborhood is pretty close-knit, so we have neighborhood meetings every other month. A police officer usually comes to tell us about any crimes we should know about. The assistant principal from the high school comes to tell us about any events going on. Stuff like that.

At our meeting last night, one of the new neighbors raised her hand to ask the police officer what we should do about a man going through our recycling bins. I've lived in this neighborhood for several years, so I know about the man she's describing, as do most of the other neighbors. He goes through the alleys and collects the cans from our recycling bins the day before the recycling truck comes through.

When my new neighbor asked the police officer what to do, the police officer hadn't heard about this guy, because no one has ever called him in. I started to explain to her that he does this before recycling days, he's just collecting cans. Many of the other neighbors nod in agreement and say that they see him too. One neighbor adds that he's talked to him a little bit and learned that he has an apartment with his brother and actually works part-time second shift at a restaurant too, so he's not homeless, doesn't need help, and is doing just fine. He just likes collecting cans for extra cash.

New neighbor can't believe we've allowed this to continue for years. ""What if he's stealing our identities?"" He's not. If you watch him for 30 seconds, it's clear he's collecting cans, not digging for information. ""He's making such a mess! There's garbage everywhere in the alleys!"" There is some trash blowing around the alleys sometimes, but it's clearly not from him, because it's not recyclables. He doesn't go in the trash bins, just the recyclable bins. We've got squirrels and raccoons and not the most careful garbage truck drivers, so that's probably where the trash is coming from.

Now, my neighbors, the police officer, and I are trying to calm this woman down and gently reassure her that he's not causing any problems. But she will not let up. She wants this man banned from the neighborhood. Finally, I kind of lost it and said, ""What is your problem? He's not bothering you at all. Just smile and wave, like the rest of us, or leave him alone."" Our neighborhood association president brought up the assistant principal from the high school to change the subject, so everyone pretty much moved on. I kind of feel like the asshole, because she's new to the neighborhood and I was obviously not very welcoming, but I really didn't like how she was trying to treat the can collector. AITA?",0

Or they said she‚Äôll take them eventually but they‚Äôll be like two hours late. 

This really pissed me off, especially since my niece absolutely never cooks for them (they live on McDonald‚Äôs and Denny‚Äôs), their apartment is nasty, and the girls have needed their hair cut for months but instead my niece lets them run around looking like crap.

"WIBTA if I tell my BIL that my wife (his sis) is an alcoholic | WIBTA if I (50M) tell my BIL that my wife(52F) (his sis) is an alcoholic?  Wife and I have been married for 25 years, and wife's drinking has progressively gotten worse over the years.  Their father is an non-drinking (now) alcoholic - been on the wagon for pretty much 3-4 decades.

I mentioned my wife's drinking 10 years ago to BIL and wife went ballistic. But since then her drinking just keeps getting worse.  In fact, in the past few months she's fallen down (gave herself two black eyes in the process), and been so drunk on two occasions she lost control of bodily functions (once pee one diarrhea) walking down the hall (thankfully we have hardwood floors)  to the bathroom, not realizing what she had done and I eventually accidentally stepped in them.  She passes out on a nightly basis and she goes through at least 6 bottles of wine, a 1.75L or Vodka,  and a 1.75L of Rum each week.

We saw my BIL at Christmas when my wife was recovering from her black eyes (still QUITE visible) and BIL asked what happened and she stated she tripped on a cushioned mat in our kitchen.  BIL knows that I would never lay a finger on my wife, in fact her family jokes if they got a call that there was domestic violence at our house, they would ask if I was OK.

Our daughter (17F) asks me why she drinks so much, I have no answer other than letting her know some people do, and that grandpa is a (recovered) alcoholic, and it is genetic.  I drink, but just barely - at most 2 hard ciders a week, if that much.

I am at the end of my rope, I have tried talking to my wife and after 'an event' she stops drinking for a week or two, before going off the edge again.  She refuses to see a counselor, because she says she is afraid that if her work finds out she will lose her security clearance and, thus, her job.

Some background: my studio apartment is actually just the top level of a house, and it sits directly across from another home. There used to be trees separating our homes to give some privacy, but they were recently cut down to get a view of the mountain behind us, so that is why this is only now becoming an issue.

&#x200B;

Recently I got a text from my landlord saying that the neighbors across the way asked me to close my curtains when it gets dark because the light shines into their bedroom window, and they go to bed at 8PM while I tend to turn my light out at around midnight. At first I profusely apologized and closed the one side that I keep open at night. However as a few weeks went by I started to get annoyed at the situation. I started thinking about the fact that if my light bothers them, why don't they just get their own curtains? It doesn't look like they have any curtains or shades anywhere on their home. Why is it my responsibility? But at the same time I don't want to be rude and affect their sleep. I'm conflicted. 

&#x200B;

 I would like to keep that half open for my cat because she likes to watch the geckos and bugs outside at night. Would I be the asshole if I started leaving that part open again until I go to sleep?",0
"AITA for telling my fianc√© not to spend Christmas with her family? | Alright buckle in folks, this is a long one. I‚Äôll go ahead and lay out the situation for everyone:

I am in the Army, currently in training as an Infantry Officer. If you want to take vacation in the Army you have to use what is called Leave Days. You accrue a certain amount of leave dates per month, 2.5/month for a total of 30/year, and you can use them however you like. You can also ask for days in advance, but that takes a whole other process that can easily get denied for whatever reason without there being a legal issue. Once you put your packet together, you send it up to your commander and they Approve/Disapprove the packet.

Well I don‚Äôt have that many days accrued because I just started active duty and none of my time as enlisted transferred leave days over since I technically left active duty before I started training. Our commander has said that he will be letting us take whatever leave we have accrued over the holidays for up to 17 days, but that he will be denying any advance leave packets because Jimmy Carter is about to die and we might have to go to D.C. for the funeral. I will have 5 days accrued by the time Christmas rolls around, but I want to save those because you also have to use leave for emergency things sometimes if it doesn‚Äôt meet certain criteria.

Other relevant information: I just got engaged last week to a wonderful woman that I‚Äôve been dating for 3 years. She is finishing up her degree this next month and then moving in with me while she studies for the MCAT.
Alright now to the nitty gritty!

When I broke the terrible news to her that Christmas might not be what we expected she was understandably upset. We had planned to fly out and do a trip with her family for the parents‚Äô 30th anniversary. But upon mentioning the fact that I know she really wanted to go on the trip, but I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll be able to as I most likely have to be here, she said, ‚ÄúOh no I‚Äôm still going, I want to be there for my parents‚Äô 30th.‚Äù

Now I totally understand, it‚Äôs a huge milestone, but they aren‚Äôt throwing a party or anything for it, we were just gonna go skiing (might I mention that I was paying for both of us because I didn‚Äôt want her parents to foot the bill). They also do something EVERY year for the anniversary so it‚Äôs not like we couldn‚Äôt go next time. So I voiced my concern that I would like her to be with me since it is our first Christmas officially ‚Äútogether‚Äù in her family‚Äôs eyes now, and I could possibly be deployed this time next year as I‚Äôm slotted to go to 10th MTN and they have done 96hr notice deployments before. She said that I was being unfair and that I was, ‚ÄúTelling her not to spend time with her family.‚Äù When in reality I just feel like I‚Äôm a part of her family now and shouldn‚Äôt be left by myself on Christmas. AITA?

Edit: I‚Äôm getting a lot of people saying I‚Äôm the asshole because I won‚Äôt be there during the day. I‚Äôll be back before she wakes up in the mornings and then a 5 minute check in at 1:30 and we‚Äôd have the rest of the day off to do whatever. I just have to be here in case he dies, in which case she‚Äôd go with me, I don‚Äôt have anything to do all day.",1

"AITA for telling a guy to stay away from me? | This guy (B) in college who I haven't even talked to more than 3-4 times told me he ""likes"" me through a friend (R). I said no. I never replied to his texts before and I still don't but now he keeps telling R that I'm ignoring him and is begging her to convince me to say yes. I told R to stay away from this and that I didn't want to be involved in all that but she keeps talking to him about me. I've tried to maintain my distance from him but then he goes and tells one of his friends (P) to convince me to talk to him in person cause he wants to talk about his feelings in person. I said no because i felt uncomfortable but all three of them kept telling to me to talk to him and i finally said ok to end the matter. When we talked I said no to him and then he said we both could be friends. I said no to that too because being friends never ends well. Now he keeps telling R to tell me to talk to him and R is annoying me. Today I just snapped and asked her if she listens to whatever he says and told the guy to stay away from me. Now they're all treating me like the bad guy. AITA?",0
"AITA for feeling my fiance gets a unfair amount of free time? | I'm a stay at home mom with a 1 1/2 year old, my fiance works fulltime and takes care of all bills. I feel like I get no free time compared to him. Maybe I'm being a lazy asshole ( I hope not)  but he gets to sleep in on his weekend til about 2pm. On top of this he has a boys night on Sundays that starts after work at 4pm and lasts till 2am. On his work days ( sunday is the only day he works a different schedule usually it's sat-wed 2pm-9:30pm) he gets home from work at 10pm and games till 3am then goes to bed and doesn't wake up till 1pm the next day. Gets dressed and leaves for work by 2pm.

Even though we live together because of his schedule our daughter sees her father 2 days out of the week and only on his weekends. I personally only get a break to do something and go out once every 3 months.  My MIL said this is normal and expected when being a sahm but I'm starting to feel this might not be the case.

  Am I the asshole for feeling I deserve more  time to myself ? 

TL;DR fiance sleeps in during the weekends and gets a boys night once a week. I don't and feel as if its unfair AITA ? ",0
"AITA for calling out my neighbours for stealing my Tide pods. | A bit of context to establish a pattern of disrespectful behaviour.

I live in the basement apartment of a house, the main floor is a separate unit as well as the upper floor/loft. We all moved in at the same time about a year ago and the landlord does not live in the house. Early on it became clear that unless I did most of the maintenance (snow shoveling, yard work etc.) it would not get done by anybody. I honestly don't mind doing it as I would rather look at a nice neat home and it gives me an excuse to get outside. That being said I have never even had gotten so much as a ""thanks"" from anyone else in the house.

I wont deny that this has built up a fair bit of resentment. The main floor tenants are also very inconsiderate with noise. Stomping in the doors and walking around with boots and hard shoes at night, having parties mid week and leaving their yappy dogs home alone barking all night on a regular basis. I have never complained to the landlord or the city about the noise and always addressed them directly in a respectful way rather than trying to get them in trouble.

Clearly this is about more than just Tide pods.

We share a laundry room with the main floor tenants and the top floor tenant has their own. There is a row of cupboards and we each have our own to keep laundry and cleaning supplies in and to this point I just trusted that no one would steal things like that from their neighbour. Well I had noticed that we seemed to be going through our pods rather quickly so I took a peek in their cupboard and saw that they didn't have any of our own so I decided to do a little experiment. I simply counted how many were in the tub waited until they did laundry and then counted them again. Sure enough there were two pods less. So I took the remaining pods out of the laundry room and left the empty tub on the dryer with a note that said ""buy your own, thief.""

For what it's worth if they had asked I would have gladly given them whatever they needed.

Later on that day one of them texted my S/O apologizing and saying they were ""in a bind"" and would replace the pod later. They played it off as if it was a one time thing which I do not believe although admittedly o do not have any proof one way or the other. Either way later on that day there was a whole new tub of pods outside my door. 

I am satisfied with the outcome. They took something that wasn't theirs, I called them out and they apologized and replaced. End of story. My S/O thinks ITA for being rude and creating a hostile living space.

"AITA for reminding my wife to take her prenatal vitamins?? | My wife, 25, is pregnant with our first kid. I am a family doctor (29M) and so I want to make sure our baby is as healthy as possible. She's currently 5 months along. 

When we first found out she was pergnant, I bought a whole bottle of prenatal foOtr her to take every single day. However she can be a bit forgetful. She probably only takes about 3 or 4 a week when she should be taking one every single day. So lately I've gotten into the habit of handing her a vitamin and a glass of water as soon as she wakes up. 

However she's also not a morning person. Yesterday when she woke up, I tried to hand her a vitamin but she knocked it out of my hand and said ""leave me alone!"" I told her I was just trying to make sure that she was taking her pills, and she said ""they always get stuck in my throat and I hate them"". I offered to grind them and put them in applesauce and she said ""no i dont want that."" 

She appeared to be really frustrated with me. I explained to her that I just want our baby to be healthy.  Other ""unhealthy"" things she does at the moment includes eating a lot of spicy/salty foods and even potato chips. She also balances her laptop on her bump.  I try to explain to her that I want her and the bebe to be healthy, but she said I am overbearing. 

AITA? Im simply a concerned father, husband.",1
"WIBTA for not paying for my ""adult"" son's youth conference? | So, my 18 year old son is at a youth conference this week, and he may not have enough money to cover the bill at the end of the week.¬† I know he expects me to bail him out, but what would happen if I refused?

Some background:¬† This is his second year attending the conference.¬† Last year we (his parents) agreed to pay for half the cost and I think he paid for his part through grants with our church and the conference organizers.¬† This year since he is now ""an adult"" we told him that HE would be responsible for the full amount. And to make it worse, the cost doubled. He‚Äôs had a part time job for the past year, and until he got his license recently had no real financial obligations, (he pays for gas and part of the insurance on the car that I own), so he really should have no problem saving enough money.¬† However, he does not control his spending. He typically spends his paycheck as fast as he gets them, with no thought of future expenses. So, despite knowing that he has to pay for the conference, he has continued his usual spending habits, and will probably not have enough to cover the conference expenses at the end of the week. I‚Äôve told him that I will loan him the money, but I‚Äôm having second thoughts on that.¬† What would happen if when he calls at the end of the week I just tell him that he needs to work it out with the conference organizers?

If I do bail him out, I would take his debit card and probably his car keys (he can ride his bike or walk to work) until he pays me back.¬† I‚Äôm guessing that might last a week until his next paycheck.

So, WIBTA?

"AITA for turning a whole class against a student? | I‚Äôm taking organic chemistry, which is even worse than gen chem. The exams, and tests are unnecessarily hard, and the class itself is complicated. We all seem to be struggling, besides this one person. 

Our professor is unfortunately still taking her lectures very seriously, and assigned us a test worth 25% of our grade on Monday. Most of us  cheated (besides that one student) despite her claiming everyone has a different version of the test. We ended up doing much better compared to before. Well since the rat didn‚Äôt cheat, he didn‚Äôt do as well as those who cheated did, and therefore the curve was messed up. So he screenshotted the group chat texts, etc everything and emailed our professor. She cancelled our scores, and ‚Äúwill be taking further action‚Äù. 
It was clear that he‚Äôs the one who ratted like a bitch, so somehow i brought it up on the gc, and most if not all of us turned on him. Some people sent him angry texts etc calling him out. He says it‚Äôs all my fault, and this ‚Äúharassment‚Äù has caused him so much ‚Äúdistress‚Äù. AITA?

"AITA for scooping peanut butter out of my roommate‚Äôs jar with a spoon and putting it in my mouth? | I (24M) live in an apartment with a blonde female roommate (24F). We weren‚Äôt friends before I moved in. I found a room she advertised on a local Facebook housing group. She‚Äôs pretty hot and seemed to have a bustling social circle, and since I moved to this new city, I had to get in on that offer. Plus, our birthdays are only two weeks apart. Those things aren‚Äôt really important. I just wanted to share. She‚Äôs a great roommate and introduced me to some wonderful people. 


All the years I was living with other roommates, I was used to buying and consuming my own groceries by myself. We rarely shared. Maybe something like Sriracha but that‚Äôs it. However my new roommate is open to sharing her stuff. She says I can have whatever she has and I don‚Äôt need to ask her before having it. I said she could do the same for my stuff. 


Alright, so my peanut butter jar was empty and I‚Äôve been too lazy to go to the store these past few days. I sometimes like to just scoop a big scoopful of peanut butter out of the jar with a spoon and just eat it little by little. I never double dip, even with my own jar. That‚Äôs because even a giant spoonful contains around 350 calories already. I don‚Äôt think she has seen me eat like that before. Well, I did just that late last night. 


My roommate was in her room. I went to the kitchen, opened her peanut butter jar and got a big spoonful to enjoy. Because I was hungry, I was eating the peanut butter before I closed the lid. I swear I was planning on closing it within 15 seconds. Well, my roommate came out of her room to ask me something. After I answered, she saw her opened peanut butter jar and me holding half of the big scoop of peanut butter on my spoon. 


She asked me if I was eating peanut butter straight out of her jar. I said I do that sometimes. She said that‚Äôs gross. She seemed very disgusted. I‚Äôm really good-looking for an Asian guy, but I know she‚Äôs not into me. I told her that I never double dip so there‚Äôs nothing unsanitary about what I‚Äôm doing. She said she can‚Äôt trust me and told me to stop using her foodstuff. I have no history of being unsanitary. 


Yes she‚Äôs a neat freak while I‚Äôm a step or two below that, but I‚Äôm no slop either. I really don‚Äôt know why she‚Äôs so aggressive. She never is. I told her that she has to trust me on this that I really wouldn‚Äôt violate her peanut butter since I don‚Äôt even double spoon dip mine. She said she can‚Äôt trust me and to please just stay away from her foodstuff from now on. 


I think she‚Äôs scared of contracting that disease everyone‚Äôs talking about from me. She sprays the whole house with alcohol every few hours and makes me wash my hands whenever I return home. I forgot once, so she reminds me every time now. She‚Äôs a bit high-strung lately. So I told her that I won‚Äôt touch her foodstuff anymore, but she needs to know that I‚Äôm not that gross. She said ‚Äúwhatever OP, good night.‚Äù She seems angry.",1

"AITA for helping(sort of) my friend leave his wife(cheated) and children(non-biological), and hiding it from his wife and my gf? | English is not my native language. A few weeks ago I got a call from my friend at late night asking me to meet him. Apparently he had found out that both of his children weren't his. I was surprised but he showed me the paternity test results, and also his wife confessed that they might not be his(He think he's Infertile). They always had a rocky marriage.

Since then, he hasn't gone back home. I and my friends are helping him with normal stuff. He is currently living at a place owned by me. He contacted a lawyer, it's seems according to the law in our country a father can't ask for a paternity test after marriage. But the lawyer said he could win if they could somehow prove he can't be the father without a paternity test( I think that's just lawyer speak). He is going to get a fertility test. His lawyer also plans to bring in the actual father in court.

The thing is my gf is really close to his wife. She thinks we( his friends) should talk some sense into him. My gf and I went to meet the wife after my friend left. She and their kids were crying( on is 6 yr old, the other is 2). She's also a SAHM. I felt really bad, but I don't know if I should get involved. My friend called his wife and said he will only talk through a lawyer. My gf and the wife knows we are in contact with him, but they don't know that I am housing him. They also don't know that his lawyer contacted the biological father. I am wondering if I am a bad person for not telling them anything, my friend would be really pissed  if I did. AITA?

Edit: I am asking whether I'm an asshole for getting not involved? Not whether my friend is an asshole for leaving his kids( I know he sort of is, but I don't know what I would do if I had to go through this situation, so i didn't say anything to him)

Edit II:  I will tell my gf but make her promise that she will not tell the wife.

Edit III: I've decided to not tell my gf, it's hard to keep up with this site, at first everyone was telling me to tell her. Now the majority are saying to keep it a secret.",0
"AITA for warning my neighbor about his wife? | I live in a condo. Our building has 12 units, so we know our neighbors very well. I am very friendly with the couple that lives across the hall. I‚Äôm single, and they often invite me to dinner with them. I hang out with the husband pretty often. 
We have game nights, and hang out at bars together. A few days before Christmas I saw another male come and pick up the wife while the husband was at work. They went out for a couple of hours and came back. I saw them hugging. I told him to come by my house when he got off of work for a beer so that I could tell him what I saw. Later that evening I told him and he didn‚Äôt believe me. He was devastated, and went to confront his wife. 
They got into a big fight, but in the end it turned out just to be a cousin that came in from out of town to visit her. They went out for lunch. He and this cousin know each other, he was a groomsmen in his wedding. I apologized profusely to the wife and him. I tried to explain that I was just looking out for a friend. She was not having it and cursed me out. I told her that she was being extremely rude and hurtful. She doesn‚Äôt want me to hang out with her husband anymore, effectively ruining our friendship. Am I the asshole here or is she? I tried to apologize to her, and explain my reasoning. She wasn‚Äôt open to it at all. I don‚Äôt think that this is fair.",1

"AITA for asking my sister to cover her self harm scars | Ok so I know how this sounds but I have to know because it‚Äôs really getting to me.

So my sister is four years older than me and right now she is living at home having just left University and is looking for a job. When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don‚Äôt know how my parents didn‚Äôt notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She‚Äôs come a really long way since then and I‚Äôm so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I‚Äôve never been depressed or self harmed so I‚Äôm not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can‚Äôt even begin to imagine her point of view.

However around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it‚Äôs fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I‚Äôm being selfish by saying that because it‚Äôs not about me but it‚Äôs beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I‚Äôm around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don‚Äôt know how to fix this and I need to know if I‚Äôm being unreasonable.

Edit:

Thank you to lots of people. You put this in perspective for me in a way that I never could have done on my own. I‚Äôm an idiot. A massive fucking asshole. I thought that because I loved her it meant that what I was doing was the right thing for our relationship. I want to clarify that they don‚Äôt make me ‚Äòuncomfortable‚Äô they just make me want to sob and hug her forever. But yeah, that‚Äôs my issue as many of you stated and I have to deal with that without shaming her (which was never my intention). I‚Äôve read every single response to this throughout the day and I want to thank people for their honesty. My sister always refused to talk about it because she didn‚Äôt want to upset me and that‚Äôs her choice. For now I need to book a reservation at her favourite restaurant and apologise.

"AITA for snapping at my dad for refusing to take care of the dog he got? | My father recently got a puppy a month ago, about 5 months old for my oldest daughter. He had mentioned to us before he wanted to get her a pet dog because according to him ""it would calm her down ""every kid needs a dog"" ""its the best thing for her"" ""she'll love me for this!"" blah blah... I could go on and on about his convincing speech. I should also mention that he lives with us at the moment and yes he helps with bills. I asked him ""I'm on board if you help watch the puppy and pitch in, it's basically your dog after all.."" He swore up and down he'd help out, by taking it on walks etc. So fast forward, he gets her a cute female cockapoo. My daughter is overjoyed, cuddles and kisses the damn thing constantly. Sometimes we have to pry the dog off her so she can eat and go to sleep. Both my husband and myself got all the essentials out of our own pockets. Dog crate, food, puppy pads, shampoo, treats, brush, lysol and paper towels to clean up the messes...omg the messes..ugh...
Everything good right? Wrong...because lets just say this entire month my father showed his true colors. He refuses to take her out because ""ugh i'm too old for this shit, she's too hyper for me to walk her..."" Me and my husband are the ONLY ones who take her on walks and clean up her poop and pee when she goes indoors. It mostly falls on me because i stay at home while my husband works. I'm the one who feeds her, cleans when she knocks down our trash can. The one who has to get her away from things she tries to eat...the one who needs to be with her at all times because he got a puppy with separation anxiety... and at night she jumps on our bed because if we leave her out in her crate she barks and cries like crazy and no one can sleep. My father sleeps like a rock all night meanwhile i get up at 2 am every night with an alarm to allow the puppy to pee and poo so it doesnt go on our bed. I keep telling myself i'm doing it for my daughter...I'm doing this for her....i'm doing this for her....

Well, today what set me off was that its the first day of school for my daughter. I'm in a rush and getting her stuff when my dad, who was sprawled out on the sofa watching tv yells out ""THE DOG POOED!"" I was holding the door, my daughter already outside, i turn to him and go ""SO CLEAN IT!"" He stared at me in disbelief and starts achingly getting up groaning the entire time. He starts muttering ""I'm going to return this thing..im too old for this shit, you will see"" The thought of him returning the dog, my daughter's dog who she adores more than life itself. I snapped and told him ""YOURE SUCH A LAZY ASSHOLE, YOU REALLY CAN'T PICK UP SHIT FOR ONE DAMN DAY?!"" He goes ""WHERE'S THE WIPES FOR THIS?!"" And i scream back ""YOU HAD A WHOLE MONTH TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE WIPES ARE!""

"AITA for making fun of my grandma for getting a clamming ticket | I'm probably going to be the asshole but it was worth it.

So my grandma is 67 years old, this is her first ticket EVER. No speeding tickets, no parking tickets, nothing. Last weekend she went clamming and got 20 more clams then she was supposed to. An officer caught her and she got a court date. My grandma genuinely thinks shes going to jail or she'll have to take out a loan to pay the fine. 

After she got the ticket she immediately called my mom and I. We tried to reason with her and tell her the fines going to be a couple hundred dollars max and shes not going to jail. She wouldnt believe us so my mom jokingly said ""well we cant have a future felon at my daughter's birthday party"" my grandma got very mad and said ""I'm calling [aunts name]"" we later called my grandma and apologized and told her she can still come. 

So right before she gets to the my birthday party we have my dads freind change into his ""work uniform"" just like his shirt and badge(hes a cop.) To freak out my grandma So when my grandma got there she freaked out becasue she though my dads freind was going to arrest her. So durring dinner my dads freind goes to my grandma and tells her that her clam dish is delicious and asked where she got the clams. My grandma face goes so red and she blurts ""I got 20 more clams then I was supposed to, these were made with stolen clams"". My grandma leaves after that and she hasn't spoken to me since last night. I've tried to apologize but she keeps hanging up on me.

EDIT:I got a hold of my grandma, she knew I was joking and admitted it was kinda funny but she said that I should take her ""committing a crime"" so lightly

"AITA for not giving my high school bully a second chance? | So I get a snap from him, saying he ‚Äúmissed me‚Äù. I admit, I shouldn‚Äôt have been so rude because I said, ‚ÄúMiss me?

And he kept pressing me asking me to forgive him and how he‚Äôs trying to be a better person. So I just proceeded to write a big ass paragraph about how I never wanted to be associated with him and I told him to never reach out to me again, then I promptly blocked him. I know this was high school, but shit like bullying sticks with you. My self-esteem was at an all time low when he picked on me. He was one of the main reasons I had to switch schools in the first place. So AITA?

"AITA for not doing to anything to stop the spread of my dad's wife's nudes? | This is about my dad's third wife. My dad left our stepmom for the new lady. There was cheating involved.

My older sister and I absolutely love our stepmom and still see her regularly.

Right before my dad's wedding to his third wife, her nudes got leaked. And I mean leaked to every single person she knew, including her place of employment and her kids and their friends in college.

It was honestly pretty gross and as much as cheating is bad, I don't think having your nudes leaked is ok.

The wedding got postponed indefinitely and they got a quick marriage in a courthouse instead.

The thing is, I know who did it. It was my younger half-sister, the daughter of my dad's second wife.

I kind of saw the pics on her computer plus a document with the contact info of people my dad's wife knew. I never confronted her.

It looks like the pictures still being spread. I met my dad recently and he said they were both devastated by what is happening. He looked incredibly stressed and sad. I feel bad but am I the asshole for just treating this as not my problem?

"AITA for texting a stranger? | I was on the website of a pastor I enjoy listening to. He had posted about something that happened to him recently and the page allowed for comments so I went down to see what everyone else thought of his post. He's one of those pastors who likes to travel to small town churches and guest-speak. A lot of the comments were anonymous but a few of them had accounts with photos. One of them, we'll call her ""Betty"" had commented praising the pastor for his post, mentioned that they had met when he preached at her church and she felt like they had a connection and she wanted to speak to him and reconnect. Betty's profile picture and the general tone of her comment gave me the idea that she might be elderly. Based on her photo, she seemed like she was at least 70/75. In her comment she included her hometown, her church, her first and last name, and her cellphone number.

I've seen so many people post their number online where anyone can see it, especially Facebook. Just last week I saw three, ""lost my cellphone, got a new one, let me know your number!"" posts and in the comments were several phone numbers. These are all pages with no privacy settings, anyone can see them.

Anyway, I noticed a lot of trolls in the comments on the pastor's page saying some pretty awful things, commenting mean things to other commenters and I got a little worried that one of them might send ""Betty"" some nasty texts. I've been doxxed before and had some truly terrible things sent to my phone that resulted in me having to get a new number. I didn't want to see a little old lady get messed with so I sent her a text, ""hey Betty, my name is u/Apprehensive-Sorbet, I saw your number on Pastor X's blog. There are some really nasty people commenting on this post targeting users. You might want to edit your post and remove your identifying info. Have a nice day!""

A couple hours later I got a phone call from what I guess was either Betty's husband, son, or grandson, cussing and chewing me out for daring to text ""Betty"". Apparently doing so is harassing and stalking. I tried to apologize and explain why I had text ""Betty"" but her male relative wasn't having it and threatened to call the police on me. I welcomed him to do so because I figured the police might be a little happy to see someone trying to help out another stranger, or at least keep someone from being bothered.

"AITA For Ruining Probably Kid's Childhood? |  I was in Target the day after Christmas. I live in a large city so it was packed with people returning stuff and the usual shopping. I needed to use the restroom so I went to do that.   

  
  There was quite a line of people so I decided to act civilized and get in line. The man behind me had a kid (probably like 6 or 7) with him and was getting really upset really fast. While there was about 2 people a head of me a store associate came out and told us he needed a minute to clean the bathroom. Obviously none of use were happy but what are you going to do? The associate goes in the bathroom to clean it up. 

  
  Almost immediately the guy behind me starts complaining very loudly how the worker was probably in there doing nothing and making us wait on purpose. To be fair the associate did take about 10 minutes but the guy was talking loud enough that I think the associate in the bathroom could have heard it fairly clearly. I worked retail so I know how stressed the holidays are on people so I texted my girlfriend telling her it would be a while. I also texted her, ""There is a guy behind me who is acting like a baby about having to wait. He is throwing a little tantrum that is kinda funny.""     
 

 I get out of the text app and start browsing Reddit or something. The guy behind me starts really calling the associate names and generally being an asshole to the young guy who is just doing his job. I turn around and give him a look and he says to me, ""You shut up. I saw what you said about me, asshole.""   
 

 So at this point I'm a little stunned because there must have been an effort to look over my shoulder and see what I was texting. That's kinda a huge violation of privacy in my opinion. I get a little pissed fast and turn to his kid and said, ""Santa Claus is not real. It's your parents. Also the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy are not real. It's all your parents work."" I walked away at that point because I didn't want a physical altercation to happen or anything.   


  Am I the asshole? Maybe what I didn't wasn't proportional but I think it was if you have ever worked retail on the holidays and if I was the associate I would be cheering for me.  


tl;dr: Stranger acts like an asshole to retail associate, reads my private text over my shoulder, calls me an asshole for texting that he was being a baby, I tell his kid that Santa isn't real. 

Edit 1: Thanks for all the feedback! It seems split 50/50 for the most part. Keep the comments coming!

Edit 2: Didn't realize that so many tough guys were on Reddit. Noice messages! ",1

"AITA for telling my brother's what I honestly think of his lifestyle | My brother and I live together. In the past 2 or so years, my brother, who is a single gay guy, started going out to clubs every weekend and picking up strangers. They usually go to the other guy's place, they rarely come here, but sometimes they do. I noticed he was sleeping over at other people's places when he started showing up home all knackered on Sunday mornings.

I recently asked him about it and he said why not have fun while you're young. I said I'm almost the same age as him and I couldn't even imagine living like that. He said that if I want him to stop bringing people over, that he would, but I said that's not the issue. It happens rarely and besides, my girlfriend also comes over a lot, so that doesn't have to change. But I said that generally, I don't understand how he can do this without feeling empty. To sleep with people he knows nothing about and that he feels nothing for and they feel nothing for him.

He got up and said not to mention this to him again. I said I was sorry, but he said I'm not sorry, I'm an asshole. He hasn't spoken to me since. I'm genuinely surprised and I don't understand why he cares what I think but doesn't care about what he's doing. I think that maybe he doesn't actually feel so great about 'having fun while he's young' and that maybe I struck a cord.",1

"AITA for refusing to use a flip phone? | I am a 15-year-old girl in her sophomore year of high school. I currently attend a top private high school in the US. Think, like...preppy, cheerleader, dress-code breaking girl type. And mostly jock/player/Supreme and Gucci-loving boy type.

My school has two separate campuses. One for 7th, 8th, and 9th grade. One for 10th, 11th, and 12th. Since I'm in 10th, I'm new to the Upper Campus and am surrounded by upperclassmen. I prefer this, it's quite fun.

However, my school recently polled and it's come to my attention that I am the ONLY ONE on campus without a cell phone (private school in CA, not surprised myself).

My parents say that I must ""earn it"" and what this means to them is a 4.0+ GPA, a varsity sport, and other responsibilities including piano, community service, room spotless 24/7, and taking care of two dogs. Since I go to what people call ""the hardest elite school on this coast,"" it's been hard to do that. Not even my hardest-working friends had to earn their cells, and they have had them since the ages of 11 or 12.

One of my friends who left our grade last year used to have a Blackberry. Not sure which model, but it's the one that comes to mind when you think of a Blackberry. He used to constantly get slammed up against walls, called ""poor,"" etc. He was shaken from it and resented the ""more popular"" boys.

I'm not asking for the newest model; my mom gets a free phone with her work and one from a few years ago (iphone 6?) would be just fine.

My dad got home the other day with a flip phone ([https://www.att.com/buy/phones/att-cingular-flip-2-4gb-dark-gray.html](https://www.att.com/buy/phones/att-cingular-flip-2-4gb-dark-gray.html)) and said that he was going to activate it to keep in touch with me.

Keep in mind, he has all four of my best friend's phone numbers (they gave it to him willingly because they're cool with it), and CAN ALSO REACH ME ON MY LAPTOP THROUGH TEXT OR CALL when I have a Wi-Fi connection, which is all hours of the school day minus the 45 minutes I am on a bus, THAT HE DROPS ME OFF FOR AND GETS ME FROM.

I've told my parents I'd get bullied and I'd rather not use a phone at all, to which I get told, ""You'll be fine, stop being sensitive. No one cares, you're just being a wimp. It's a phone, not a bomb. We need to reach you.""

This is getting increasingly frustrating, so I said that he may activate whatever he wants but I refuse to use the flip phone in public or in front of my peers, rendering it absolutely useless. I'm perfectly fine keeping the arrangement as is rather than risking any teasing or looking/feeling like an idiot.

"AITA for wanting to rehome my dog? | I apologize in advance, this is quite lengthy.

Background: I (18f) have had my dog for 8 years. While he is technically the family dog,  I have paid for all his needs (food, supplies, pet insurance, etc) and I‚Äôm the only one who feeds and walks him (but he still gets love and attention from the rest of my family). I‚Äôm perfectly okay with this setup since it was what we agreed to when my parents allowed me to adopt him. This fall, I‚Äôll be attending a school hours away from my home and I can't take the dog with me. I had originally planned to attend a school nearby so that I would still be able to live at home, but some unexpected issues came up.

While I would love nothing more than for my dog to be able to live at home with my family even when I‚Äôm gone, I don‚Äôt think they will be able to adequately care for him. My parents work most of the day and it would be difficult for them to contribute, and my sister (13f) just isn‚Äôt interested in the responsibility portion that comes with having a pet. I have plans to give him to some of our family friends that live just a couple streets away from us- they just lost their beloved dog last year and are looking to adopt. They are very close to us and my dog absolutely adores them, he has known them his whole life. They have dog-sat multiple times and are in a position where they would be able to take very good care of him. Since they are practically like family, we see them all the time just for dinners and stuff. If my dog was to go live with them, I know my family would be able to see him whenever they wanted.

I talked it over with my parents, and although they aren‚Äôt super happy about it they understand and say that it‚Äôs ultimately my choice. My sister on the other hand is absolutely livid with me. I completely agree why she would be upset, but she has made no effort to step up to the plate to actually take care of him. I‚Äôve given her multiple trial weeks where I‚Äôll ask her to be responsible for the dog‚Äôs basic needs, and every single time she hasn‚Äôt put in effort. I‚Äôll have to remind her multiple times when it‚Äôs walk or feeding time, but she still did it only when she felt like it, if even at all. I had to pick up her slack every single week we tried. I‚Äôm worried when I‚Äôm not there, it‚Äôll be even worse with no one reminding her. The dog shouldn‚Äôt have to suffer.

Right now I‚Äôm pretty convinced rehoming will be what‚Äôs best for my dog, but my sister still isn't happy. She has brought up the fact that I‚Äôd be taking away the only home and family my dog has ever known, and to her the dog she‚Äôs had for as long as she can remember. I know he‚Äôs entirely comfortable with the family/home he would be going to, but I would never want him to feel abandoned. And I do love my sister and I know she loves my dog, but I just can‚Äôt bring myself to trust her to take care of him after she failed to prove to me that she could during the various opportunities I gave her.

"AITA My friend asked me to be her bridesman, but I bailed during the bridal shower and bachelorette party because I felt uncomfortable. | So last year, one of my best friends got engaged. We have been close for years as best friends and I was thrilled for her. I did not know her fiance, but she wanted me at her wedding and asked if I would be one of her bridesmaids, or a bridesman if you will. I got a chuckle out of the idea, but I really wanted to be there for her more than anything because friends support friends. I also live in a different city and state, and I wanted to see someone whom I do not see often. So I said yes.

I am the only man in the group and did not know the other women before. I still do not know everyone. But I went to the bridal shower this past weekend, and I felt very uncomfortable. This was my very first one, too, and did not have any idea of what I was getting into. I am shy and don't always take to people immediately, but I thought the people there were not terribly friendly. I also forgot a gift (I am an asshole there no doubt). 

The first game was seeing who had the most unique items in their purse. That was followed by games such as who knew the most about the soon-to-be-bride and guessing if the groom or the bride did ""these things first"". I was the only man there and just felt very out of place. I learned that the bachelorette party was changing, and was going to involve a sleepover. 

I felt so uncomfortable that I faked a sudden family event and left the party as the bridal party was getting ready to party. I didn't want to tell my friend/bride that I was uncomfortable and lied. 

I am openly gay. I have dabbled in what it means to be masculine my entire life. But the more I am in this role, the more uncomfortable I am. But I also believe that friends support friends, and I feel as if I am at a crossroads.",0
"AITA for wanting my own bedroom on annual vacation if it bumps up the cost for everyone? | 13 of us rent a different cabin every year for an extended weekend. Five couples, two single girls, one single guy (me), all mid-20's. We've done this for a few years, and only one year did I get a *bed*room for myself to much debate from a few people. 

The issue is that that small bump in price per person is enough to push the price above some peoples' budget for the weekend. While some of us are willing to split the price increase to cover the difference for those with a budget, ""Quria can just sleep on a couch"" gets thrown around constantly while house hunting. 

I get that it's easier and cheaper for everyone if I just sleep on the couch or floor, but it's my bloody vacation too and I want to sleep in a bed even if it's three nights. 

Edit: Because it's apparently confusing, 

1) I'm the single **guy**.

2) I am one of the people paying extra to help cover the people that can't afford price increases of any kind. ($150-$170 for myself to $200 for budgeted couples). ",0

"Aita for refusing to make my kids share rooms in a new blended household | I currently live with my 2 kids (13 M and 10 F). I got married to my current wife last November. She has 2 kids of her own (10 M and 9 F). All our kids have known eachother for awhile and are pretty comfortable considering we have been in each others lives for 4 years. 

Her and her kids are set to move in with mine and I at the end of the month. We live in a 4 bedroom house. Now I must add that the basement is what I like to call ‚Äúsemi-finished‚Äù. There is a room down there that can be made into a nice bedroom with the proper work done. What sucks is that there is no bathroom down there though. 

Here‚Äôs the issue. I promised my kids that their rooms would not change. And I intend to keep that promise. This means that they will not have to switch rooms, or share rooms. I believe that, Atleast for the near future, we use the fourth bedroom and put both her children in there. And down the line whatever happens with the basement might happen. 

Her idea is that her son will move in with my son and her daughter in with mine. She works from home more often than she actually goes into the office, and would love to make the empty bedroom into an office. So she‚Äôs not ‚Äúworking at the dinner table‚Äù. 

She thinks I need to explain to my children that things are going to need to change a bit because of the blending families. My kids were nervous about this merger since the wedding, and being their dad I told them they don‚Äôt have to worry.

A little more info. My kids mother is not in their lives. Long story. My wife‚Äôs kids spend  every other weekend with their father. 

Aita for refusing to budge on this issue? 

I don‚Äôt want my wife to think I don‚Äôt care about her kids, but I know it‚Äôs going to be hard on mine. They refer to not wanting ‚Äúannoying little shadows‚Äù around them in their rooms.

"AITA For locking my kids out of the car when leaving Costco? | My uncle (dad's very younger brother ~13years) doesn't have Reddit, so here it is. 

**Clarification:**

**These are his biological children**

He took the kids 8F, 11M to Costco yesterday. He says it was perfectly fine in the car trip to Costco, and there wasn't a problem when shopping. The only problem was when the kids wanted to stop by the food court and get pizza, when they were already going to meet with my family and grandparents in a couple of hours for dinner. 

11M starts wailing and having a tantrum, and starts screaming how my uncle isn't his father, and 8F picks up on this and is screaming in unison. There's people looking at the scene, and some employees were talking with each other. 

I think my uncle's a pretty level-headed guy, so I'm sure he tried explaining that they're going to eat anyway so that they didn't need pizza right now, and they'll probably get pizza the next time they go to Costco. 

Eventually it comes to the point that my uncle just leaves the kids and went to the car with groceries in tow. The kids were still screaming, but eventually they got the sense to walk back to the car. By this point, my uncle had finished loading and was in the car, locked. The kids tried to get back in the car, but were repeatedly told that ""I'm not your dad anymore."" 

By his account, the kids were crying for about 5 minutes until he unlocked the car and let them back in. After he gave them the verbal lesson of why it's wrong to act like this, they went back home and came to our house for dinner. 

Personally, me, my dad, and my uncle think it's a good lesson to teach, but my aunt, mom, sister, and grandparents think my uncle went too far. I guess my uncle could have let them in the car when they were crying, but that's for a different argument.",0

"AITA - friends pregnancy announcement | My best friend knows that I have been struggling with infertility for 3 years now and knows that I really struggle sometimes.

She recently told me she is pregnant. (Til now she hasn‚Äôt been trying.) She did so by sending me a picture of her scan, a smiley face and a gushing message that read ‚Äòso looks like you will be sharing your birthday with someone special this year! :-)!!‚Äô  I am happy for her and said as much, but jst wish She could have been more tactful with how she told me. So I sent her an email..

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Hi *,

First of all, congratulations on your pregnancy. This is absolutely not something to take away from that, it is amazing news and I am happy for you.

But I need to get this off my chest. You know that we have been trying for 3 years now. That is three years of heartbreak and gut wrenching loss every single month. I grieve, but have nothing to grieve for. Every month it changes who I am as a person. 

Every pregnancy announcement hits me hard. Famous people, because it‚Äôs all over media, people I work with because then I have to watch their pregnancy, and then hardest of all are friends. Because I want to be happy for them and share their excitement, but I know I have to spend the next 9 months and then onwards watching them as they go on a journey I‚Äôm not sure I will ever experience.

I spend my life waiting for the next pregnancy announcement and wondering which of my friends it is going to be, but knowing it won‚Äôt be me.

When * told us she was pregnant, I was in the supermarket and I burst in to tears in the middle of the aisle. * told us over Skype, but I had * with me so that made it easier.

One of my best mates over here, who knows what I am going through, first found out where I was and checked I wasn‚Äôt at work. She then rang * found out where he was and let him know she was going to tell me. She then rung me, and very gently told me that she was pregnant and nearly cried for me. After that, she rang * back and asked if I was okay.

You may not realise this, but how it‚Äôs announced makes a massive difference. For me, sharing the pain with **** is the only thing that helps. 

Being sent a photo of an ultrasound, and a gushing message that I get to share my birthday, was the hardest way to receive a pregnancy announcement. 

You didn‚Äôt know where I was, who I was with or what I was doing.

I am exited for you, and yes I know what you have been through too, but that way I thought at least thought you may have had some idea and some tact around how you told me. God knows I wouldn‚Äôt have told you on viber with a photo of the one thing I so desperately want but don‚Äôt have. 

Sorry, I just need some time to figure out where I am at. 

Congratulations again, I hope all goes well.

"AITA for moving out of my apartment since my lease is being canceled. | So about 4 months ago my GF and I started to notice a pretty severe black mold problem in our apartment. I live with my girlfriend and 3 other roommates in a 3 bedroom apartment. The problem continued to worsen. The landlord consistently failed to remedy the situation. Finally, we decided enough was enough. I got with all my roommates and we discussed our options. We all came to agreement that everyone wanted out of the lease ‚Äúat all costs‚Äù. 

Luckily, I have a family member that is a lawyer and specializes in property and tenant disputes law. I told my roommates I could contact him and he would help us free of cost. They all agreed this was a great option. 

After contacting my family member, he sent a letter to our landlord. Basically it gave them the legally required time to fix the problem or else our lease would be cancelled after a month from when they received the letter. It also said that it would be best for both parties if they just flat out let us out of the lease. 

After this was explained to me, I went straight to my roommates. My GF and I showed them the letter and asked for their approval. Which they quickly gave us. I told them explicitly there is a chance the lease could end sooner, so look for a place no later than the end of the month. After that my family member sent off the letter. 

A few weeks after this we receive notice the landlord is letting us out of the lease. We need to provide them with the date we will all vacate the apartment. As soon as we heard this we texted our roommates informing them of the situation. My GF and I had found an apartment for the end of the month, as I had informed the others to do as well. We told them we would be moving out at the end of the month and we asked them when  they would like to vacate and end the lease. One roommate then told us it sounded like we had already made a plan and were leaving them ‚Äúhigh and dry no matter what‚Äù. We then informed her the lease would not end when we left, but instead when they found a new place. In the past we have even offered for them to stay with us at our new place until they can relocate. 
We also told her we would still help clean our part and assist them in moving as much as possible even if we leave first. 

She is currently being distant and somewhat cold to us. We do not want to leave her high and dry in the slightest, but she believes we are. AITA?

She said that it was part of the admin's eating disorder, and that I should pick up a book, or just stick to not talking in group settings like usual. I thought that was a pretty mean thing to say and came back with ""Maybe she should stick to not talking about her mental health issues in the office if they're so sensitive.""

I'll admin I got a little heated, but I don't feel like it was wrong of me. However she and a few other admins have been nasty towards me. I looked up what fear food was and as a peace offering I brought in a PB Twix for the admin since she said she'd gotten over it. I left it on her desk and she left that day in tears, and now several people won't even talk to me. AITA?",1
"AITA for telling my friend my other friends weight loss was more impressive? | Friend A has lived with me and another friend for the past five years but Friend B I have known since highschool and has been friends with Friend A for about the same time she‚Äôs lived with me. Over the past two years Friend A has completely transformed themselves from obese to this fit muscled chick, see pictures of the before and after you dont think you are looking at the same person. Mainly Friend A has managed to do this because they stopped drinking and thats what I think is impressive. Friend A has been an alcoholic for as long as I‚Äôve known them, high functioning but we are talking over a wine bottle a night. Due to reasons Friend A stopped drinking. I have seen her struggle, I live with her, I‚Äôve seen her pretty low and I haven't seen my other friend struggle.

Friend B has at worst, been a little chubby. About half a year ago Friend B decided she wanted to ‚Äúget into shape‚Äù. She hired a personal trainer and dietitian and is now in shape according to her. I can‚Äôt tell the difference, i‚Äôm not trying to be a jerk I just don‚Äôt see it. But I‚Äôm happy for her because she‚Äôs happy with it. Which she mentions a lot...like a lot, a lot. Our group goes out to eat? She talks about what she can and can‚Äôt have. She hits clubs with us and its all about how she‚Äôs going to have to work off the drinks. Someone mentions anything about weight loss and she has advice for them (Friend A does not do this).

I can deal with this but she keeps bringing Friend A into it, even when Friend A isn‚Äôt around. She compares her health journey (her words not mine) to Friend A and how they understand each other's struggles. But has on a few occasions said she has it so much harder than Friend A because since Friend A doesn't drink anymore she doesn't have to work off all the calories in alcohol.

There was a party at my house a few nights ago. Friend A went out cause didn‚Äôt feel like being around drinks. Friend B asked where she was I mentioned she was out because of party and then friend B launched into her whole it's easier for Friend A. But Friend A is literally not at this party because of the alcohol. Whilst B is indulging, A is avoiding it, like how is it easier to give into your cravings than actually fight against them? I said she needs to stop bringing up her health journey all the time because its nothing compared to Friend A who struggled alone without a personal trainer or dietitian and with fighting an addiction the entire time. It basically ended with me shouting something along the lines of ‚ÄúYour weight loss is not impressive in anyway compared to Friend A, in fact I cant tell the difference between the before and the after you!‚Äù. Friend B left crying, the party sort of continued but seemed to end short. Friend B and I are not talking right now and the friend group is very carefully not taking anyone‚Äôs side but my other roommate said that whilst what I said was justified I did come across like an asshole.",1
"WIBTA If we forbid an obese girl to take part at a scouting trip to Norway. | As mentionend in the title i am a scout leader from germany. This year is a huge trip to Norway for all scouts between the age of 12 to 18. 
8 of our kids want to take part. Problem is: its a 2 week long hiking trip (10-20 km a day) and only one week camping at a campsite. No problem for most of them, but there's one girl that keeps us worrying. She's 16 yo and weights about 130 kg. There was a test event where everyone  carried their hiking Equipment + 5kg for community equipment. She maneged 5 km before quitting and calling her parents to get her home. 
The trip is in 3 weeks and i know that she cant make it. Problem is: If she stays somewhere and cant go on, nobody in her group does, because of the scout mindset and being a group bla bla...
In my opinion its unfair that the whole group needs to fuck up their trip and hollidays just because of one unfit girl. She knew that she is not capable of doing this kind of excercise but still signed in and this makes me angry

WIBTA if we forbid her to take part because she would destroy the trip for everyone else?

Ps. Sorry for bad grammar i'm still learning ;)

Edit: we already talked to her parents an her saying that she needs to train every day but it seems like she's not doing it at all. And its not possible to pick her up everyday.",0

"AITA For leaving my girlfriend at the supermarket? | We were suppose to go and grab grab 4 things.  toothpaste, kale, potatoes & Olive oil. So when we get there we spilt up and I go grab kale and potatoes since they're close together and she'll get the rest. So I get the stuff and head over to where the toothpaste is. When I arrive she's talking to some person, I'm thinking it will just be some short convo but no 5 minutes turns into 10 then 10 turns into 20. 

During these 20 mins I'm just standing, holding the basket while also checking my phone occasionally. I didn't say because I figured she knew I was right there and could tell I was ready to go. Finally I had enough and just set the basket down on ground and walked out then started to walk home. She was so invested in this convo she didn't realise I left until 10 mins later. she texted me to see where I was at.

What was suppose to be a 15 min store run tops turned into a 40 min one. This wasn't even a friend she knew just a random store worker. And I guess she was mad because I could've waited Just a little longer and that she had to carry all the groceries herself.",1
"UPDATE: AITA for not wanting a relationship with my parents now they've cut me off? | Recap on [my first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/g06g8u/aita_for_not_wanting_a_relationship_with_my/):  My parents cut me off financially with 10 days notice and BS reasoning. They had offered to pay my rent throughout university so I had 10 days to find a new place to live. I ended up sleeping on my friend's sofa. About 6 weeks of no contact later, they called me asking why I hadn't called to wish my mum a happy birthday. I wanted to know if I was TA for not wanting anything to do with them given the way they cut me off. It later came out that the reason they cut me off is that my older brothers told them I'm a lesbian (which... I might be. Still figuring that out. But my brothers didn't know that). I sent my parents proof my brothers lied and they apologised but I've not forgiven them and probably won't ever. I'd applied for emergency housing and a full student finance loan but as I couldn't prove my parents cut me off the services I had to go through said they couldn't help me. I was also looking into a work placement as my course offers them and they pay a decent amount.

So here's how everything has shaped up:

* I won't be getting emergency housing from uni. I've not heard anything and there's less than a month left before summer, so I'd be shocked if I got it at this stage.
* I'm still living with my friend. She got me a job at her workplace but refuses to take any rent off me so I've been repaying her by sneakily buying food and cooking her dinner as I get home before her. We have plans to move in together this summer ready for next year.
* My parents have done a complete 180 and now want me to forgive them so badly that they're still refusing to sign a letter showing they've cut me off, so I'm still fucked with student finance. My parents have also offered me my truck back, so me, my roommate, and 2 more friends will be going to my parents' house some time soon to collect my truck and some things from my room. My tutor has written a letter for me for student finance which they might accept but I'm waiting to hear back.
* My course changes were approved so now I'm doing what I want, not what my parents want, and it looks like I got my work placement, so I'll be either working and studying part time for 2 years or working all next year and finishing studies the year after. Either way I'll be adding an extra year to my course but I get paid and get relevant experience in my field.

Ultimately, everything seems to have worked out as well as it could. Thanks to everyone who commented because a lot of you had great advice and thought of stuff I didn't, and I was truly concerned that I was in the wrong so thanks for the reassurance, too. I will also be booking a session with the on campus mental health professional because this has really shone a light on just how fucked up my family is. Thanks again :)",0
"AITA for making my sister with an eating disorder uncomfortable while she was making food? | My little sister has struggled with an eating disorder on and off for a few years. She was underweight t some point but not really now. I guess lately she's been ok because my parents don't really talk about it and I know she doesn't see a nutritionist anymore but just a therapist a couple times a month. I still kinda worry though but I didn't see much of my sister when she was at her worst (I recently moved back home after being away) so IDK if I'm wrong here.

Basically today she was making lunch and I came upstairs in the kitchen. Our parents were not home.  'If you want the kitchen, I'll be out in a couple minutes.' I said okay and just stood there watching her make her food. She didn't notice at first but when she did she said 'Uh could you not?' I said 'I just want to make sure you're okay, eating and everything."" She looked at me really weird and said 'I'm fine, it's none of your business and you're making me uncomfortable.' I said that wasn't my intention I just was checking on her. I really didn't mean anything except making sure she's eating. She said I was the last person she'd confide into about her problems anyways. Ouch. We don't have a great relationship but I want her to like eat and be okay and stuff.

She finished making food and stomped off. Later my mom told me my sister had talked to her and my mom explained to me my sister was actually doing good but I was making her feel like a child 'making sure she eats' and my parents trust her to eat, and it's been a while since things have been really bad.

I guess I could see how I was wrong but am I really an ah?",1
"AITA for being suspicious and lightly irritated that my MIL is manipulating me/us? | My husband's family has a standing yearly tradition of a family camping trip. It's held on the same weekend every year, and MIL expects all of her kids to come (it's basically 2nd Christmas at this point). It has only changed weekends a couple of times in the last 2 decades, causing chaos, sooo they don't change it idly. Also of important note, MIL organises and purchases everything, then divides the cost by person and each family reimburses her for their portion. No one has a problem doing this, including us. 

I love this trip. I look forward to it every year, because it's often the only vacation hubby and I get. This year however, the camping trip weekend falls 6wks after my due date. 

I made an idle comment to MIL a couple weeks before Christmas about us planning on coming, and massively looking forward to it, while simultaneously hoping that I'll feel up to us coming...basically a hope and plan for the best but mentally prepare for the worst type conversation.

She became visibly irate, and asked WHY I thought we might not come.

....b-because I will have very recently pushed a squashed watermelon out of my baby purse (or if I'm unlucky had my abdomen carved open, rifled through, then slapped back together like a Thanksgiving turkey) and I physically might be in extreme discomfort or pain, rendering the idea of being in an unpredictable, ""rustic"" environment with shared (and probably less-than-sanitary) facilities entirely unappealing?

She made a face and didn't say anything else about it, but a couple weeks later at Christmas, hubby and I's Christmas gift was a homemade gift certificate explaining that our family's camping expenses were prepaid in full. 

I mentioned to hubby that I was SUPER APPRECIATIVE of this gesture, but that I simultaneously feel that she's manipulating me into a position of not being able to say ""no"" to coming on the camping trip, which I dislike. He was irritated with me for seeing ulterior motives in his mom's generosity.

TL;DR - I tell MIL we *might* not be coming on a traditional yearly camping trip due to my having given birth just weeks prior, she responds by paying for our portion of expenses...I feel she's manipulating me/us into coming, hubby feels I'm being ungrateful and petty. AITA?",0
"AITA for telling my friend that his wife‚Äôs picture was inappropriate and potentially hurtful | My friend and I both have kids in the same grade at the same school. This happened at the Parent‚Äôs Day celebration in May.

The school did presentations for the parents by grades. Our kids read a little blurb about each parent while a slide show of the parents and their kids played. My friend‚Äôs wife‚Äôs picture with their daughter showed the daughter hanging on her and the mother holding a bottle of wine and giving a thumbs up. It got a laugh but seemed pretty repugnant to me; how will that girl feel when she grows up and realizes that everyone was laughing because the picture showed a mom so annoyed with her kid that she needed to drink?

I pulled my friend aside and told him how I felt and advised him to be more careful and to tell his wife to be more thoughtful. He did not take it well and snapped at me to mind my own business. Apparently their kid chose the picture, and he did not like it when I said that his wife should‚Äôve double checked what she chose.

My friend has not spoken to me since then and when I rang him up for golf, he never returned my message. My wife thinks I should‚Äôve kept my mouth shut, but I know I wasn‚Äôt the only parent who was bothered with the photo. Am I an asshole for this?",1

"AITA for planning my husbands birthday the way I did? | So our family has been going through a bit of a stressful situation that I can‚Äôt detail, but it‚Äôs been putting a lot of pressure on my husband. So of course he is busy trying to make the right decisions for us, and can‚Äôt really be bothered with making other types of decisions. I tried to talk to him about what he would like to do for his birthday and he just couldn‚Äôt give me any answers. Fair enough, I totally get that. So I decide to make plans for him myself.

We have three kids. Oldest is 7 and youngest is 7 months. We can‚Äôt exactly do things on a whim and need to definitely plan it out in advance, especially if we want to do it without the kids.

So I decide to get a sitter for Friday evening (he works Sat-Wed). I got REALLY nice tickets to a local baseball game (which he LOVES to attend!) I asked him BEFORE I bought the tickets if this is a good idea and he said ‚Äúyes thanks!‚Äù GREAT! Green light given!

Then I remembered that it‚Äôs my Dad‚Äôs birthday too (their birthdays are 4 days a part). They get along pretty well. So I figured, hey maybe two birds one stone? Neither my dad or husband like to be fussed about on their birthdays but definitely appreciate doing a little thing. So I asked husband if he would mind if I had my dad tag along with us for the game. He said he didn‚Äôt care. I asked again, and said ‚ÄúThis first and foremost is your birthday present, so I just want to make sure you are OK with this, it‚Äôs your decision‚Äù and he just kind of brushed it off again. I asked again a few days later. He responded he didn‚Äôt care again. Alright, he can‚Äôt be bothered to make these little decisions and he says he doesn‚Äôt care, so I invited my dad. 

My dad is VERY excited about going to the game too. So I set up the baby sitter for the kids. I work until 5. Sitter comes at 6. Game starts at 7. 

Tomorrow is the game. This morning, husband said to me ‚ÄúHow about we skip the game, and go to dinner and a movie instead?‚Äù I asked why. He said ‚ÄúThe game doesn‚Äôt start until 7, it probably won‚Äôt end until 9. I have to be up early for work‚Äù I said ‚ÄúOkay but I am not sure how dinner and a movie would get us home earlier? We don‚Äôt have a sitter until 6. And I already got the tickets to the game. And I already invited my dad‚Äù. 

His face dropped. He said ‚ÄúI thought that was MY decision?‚Äù I said ‚ÄúWell it was, but you just kept saying you didn‚Äôt care, and I figured you really didn‚Äôt care, so I invited him‚Äù

He stopped talking and just said ‚Äúk‚Äù. I can tell he is upset. I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry but I did try to ask what you wanted. I had to make a decision and this was what I decided.‚Äù And he just continued to not respond to me (yes this was in PERSON) and then I had to go to work. So we haven‚Äôt been able to talk since.

Now I can‚Äôt help but feel like an asshole.",0

"AITA for wanting to slowly cut my husband's best friend out of our lives? | Throwaway to be safe...

I would be among the first to vouch for Best Friend‚Äôs character. I'm not shy about the fact that he is an exceptionally kindhearted, giving, compassionate man. But I'm also not shy about the fact that none of those traits have stopped my disdain for him from growing. 

My husband and I have been married for eleven years. He has known Best Friend for nine years. It's not like they even grew up together. They met through work, when Best Friend moved here. They're first responders. Husband and Best Friend have been inseparable since then. That's basically a literal statement. That's why I'm over it. 

Husband considers Best Friend family. Like, we've actually ARGUED because I've tried to stress that though Best Friend might be *like* family, he is not. A man that wasn't even present in our lives for our wedding or our oldest daughter‚Äôs birth can't be family. Don't get me wrong, I have my own friends, but they are friends. They aren't on the same level as my sister. I don't invite them to family functions. Our kids don't have close relationships with them.

Husband and Best Friend are...too close. Before anyone says it, I am one thousand percent sure neither of them are gay. They just have a really weird enmeshed relationship. They have other friends, but none half as close as each other. Our kids (girls ages 10, 8, and 4) ADORE Best Friend. They have made crafts and drawn pictures and excitedly saved them for when he came over. They love playing with him. He's now their preferred babysitter over my sister, which the 8 year old has made known and hurt my sister deeply. He loves them as well and while part of me is glad the girls have so many adults who dote on them, it also makes me wonder what message we are sending them. My belief is family first. He's not family.

It's gone so far he even comes to holiday gatherings and Husband goes out of his way to include him. He's came to Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter even year we host for probably the past five or six years. We exchange gifts (I grudgingly play along). He spoils the kids. He helps set up egg hunts, clean up, wrangle the kids, whatever. MY FAMILY ASKS IF HE'LL BE COMING IF THEY ARRIVE FIRST. My mother isn't even that fond of my husband and she just thinks Best Friend is amazing. This has always been so awkward to explain. The first year he came, or when extended relatives catch glimpses of him in pics posted to Facebook. ‚Äúwho's the redhead?‚Äù Well, uh, it's this guy Husband knows‚Ä¶

He even acts better than family honestly. I don't find it endearing, I find it unsettling. He plowed my mom and aunts driveways with the blizzard. He's helped us out numerous times with everything from home repairs to money to last minute childcare. What is he getting out of it???

The thing that has really been bothering me is Husband‚Äôs aunt‚Äôs funeral. It was a big fight for us. Husband was very close to her and wanted me to come along for moral support. The funeral was in another state. I simply could not do it. Funerals and death are overwhelming for me; I would have nonstop panic attacks. Husband was upset by this and said he couldn't do it alone. I apologized and said I couldn't help it, but I would support him as best as I could in all other ways. I thought it was done, until about three days before the funeral he came home from work and said BEST FRIEND WAS GOING WITH HIM. And he actually did! I was and still am so weirded out. What the fuck? Just two men in their thirties and three little girls? What did Husband's extended family even think? What did they say? According to husband no one even pressed about it after Husband introduced him, but I honestly don't believe that for a flat minute. I mean really, how would you react? 

Best Friend is taking my place now. Being my husband's plus one is too far. Just because I couldn't go, I feel he was way out of line. It's inappropriate. I don't think that just because Best Friend has a sob story past (abusive parents and brother he's estranged from, no other family, grew up in foster homes, boo hoo) that means we should somehow be taking up the slack. There's so much more. He consumes too much of my husband's time. Don't get me wrong, he's not neglecting me or the kids. I just find it inappropriate. They work together, then end up doing something out and about once a week or so, then he's at our house. Holiday dinners, birthday parties, barbecues...always there.

I want to start separating ourselves from him. I think it's inappropriate and unhealthy for Husband to be so wrapped up in someone who, despite what he's said, is NOT his brother. I have tried being passive and slightly cold hoping he will get the hint but so far no luck. I told Husband this after yet another Christmas where Best Friend is the only non-blood related person to attend. Husband was immediately defensive and gave a hard NO. Said I was insensitive. Perhaps I could be a little more tactful, buy I'm almost ten years into this crap!! The truth is I want to slowly cut him out of the picture until he's an obscure """"relative"""". They see each other at work, why isn't that enough? Just by those hours husband is close to seeing him just as much as he sees me in a week. When you throw in all the extra, it is probably more. He's changed my husband, too. Husband used to be the assertive, hotheaded type. He'd get into a fist fight if someone looked at him the wrong way. For the past several years since he and friend got really close he's left that macho stuff behind. He's much more patient and passive...just like guess who. I'm not sure what to make of it. On one hand I guess it's good, but why was it HIM that got him to change?

Am I the asshole for wanting to keep FAMILY pure and set a good example for our young children? I think I'm being reasonable. I've put up with this intrusion for long enough. They're lucky I don't demand a full and immediate ban of Best Friend at our house; I'd be fully within my rights to do so. Instead I'm trying to follow my heart with some compassion and my husband acts like I'm some blackhearted witch.

"WIBTA If I kicked my sister off my switch? | My sister lives with me and has been using my Nintendo switch for Animal Crossing recently. I've wanted to play this for a long time and even pre ordered the game.

&#x200B;

On the switch, Animal Crossing shares a save file with all users. That means if my sister gets really far into the game, then I progress with her. This has happened, she has completed a large portion of the game and I feel lost in the game. It's like joining a friend group after they have all been best friends since kindergarten; you don't understand their jokes, you don't understand their stories, and you feel like you don't belong.

My copy is a digital download, so she can't just borrow my game. I want my sister to get her own switch, but she has been reluctant to considering its only one game. She doesn't want to pay another $60 for the game and $200 for the switch, which is reasonable. 

This game means a lot to me, and it's irritating that I can't play the game I paid for. I bought my switch for this game and for a couple of other games. My question is, would it be an asshole move to tell her to get her own switch to play the game?",0

"WIBTA for asking my brother for an upgrade instead of a replacement? | A week ago my brother broke my laptop. He had to be in school by 9, I had a day off, I went for a run around 8 and was gone about an hour. In that time my brother did not wake up. I had a deadline at 12noon so I got back from my run, showered, put my headphones in and started the final edits on my assignment. I assumed that he had woken up and gone to school in the time I was out running, it never occurred to me that he was still sleeping. Around 11:30 my brother woke up and came downstairs. He yelled at me for not waking him, and I replied that I was sorry he was running late but it's really not my job to wake him, and told him that if he wanted I could ring in to his school and make up an excuse for him being late. The whole time I was saying this I was also on my laptop, editing my coursework, and he asked me if I could drive him. I said that my coursework was due in less than half an hour and I'm not finished, and told him when the next bus is.

He then took my laptop and threw it. It hit the opposite wall and broke in half at the hinge. I tried to turn it back on but it wasn't working. I then drove to the nearest library, found my backup (which had a bit less editing but most of it was there) and uploaded that. I was exactly 7 minutes late. At my university they don't care if it's 7 seconds late, anything beyond the deadline gets referred, meaning the grade is capped at 40%, which is the minimum for a pass. This happened to my grade, so I got 40% on this assignment when my average grade is 78% and my lecturer has told me that my essay was worth 94%, but because it was in late there's nothing she could do.

I had insurance on the laptop, but it didn't kick in until I'd had the laptop for 45 days, and I was on day 37. Because of this, the company won't replace or fix it. Mum has said my brother needs to buy me a new laptop. When I bought the (now broken) laptop it was full price at ¬£250. It's not a very good laptop, only 2gb of memory, it was just meant for writing up assignments. Now, because of black Friday, the laptop is on sale for ¬£129. The same laptop has other models with more storage and better battery life and stuff like that, and the model that is 2 up from my one (8gb memory) is on sale for ¬£239. My brother does not know which version I got.

WIBTA if I told my brother that he needs to get me the better model?

Info for people asking: He did have an alarm. It wakes *me* a lot of the time, and I'm in the next room over. He wakes up, turns it off, sometimes he'll do something, like eat or go to the bathroom, and then he'll just go back to sleep. No way to tell most days whether he stayed awake or not.

Also, I know I shouldn't have left it so late, but the uni submission area only lets you upload your assignment once and then the submission area closes. They're trying to fix it so you can upload as many times as you want, but right now you only get one upload, so most people wait until the last minute to get as much time to edit as possible.

My average grade was 78% before this, the 40% took it down to 68%. The 94 would have brought it somewhere over 80%. I have one assignment left to bring it back up, but I'm not going to be able to get it back over 80%.",0

"AITA FOR KICKING MY SON OUT? | My (64M) 21 year old son, his then-girlfriend, her young child, and their baby daughter recently moved to my city from out of state. I live in an expensive west coast city, so I welcomed them with open arms into my home while they got situated.¬†

Everything was going smoothly until two months in and my son was arrested on a robbery charge. Although my son has a spotty criminal history that has caused some tension in our family in the past, his robbery charge is far and above anything he‚Äôs ever done, and it put a very bad taste in my mouth. He‚Äôs often careless, a bit selfish, and can be very immature at times. I was very angry at him when it happened (I still am) for throwing away his life and putting his girlfriend and my grandkids into a very difficult spot. His girlfriend broke up with him while he was being held in jail, and I also told him that he was not welcomed back into my home.

It has been roughly a year, and my son has been released from jail. My grandkids and his ex girlfriend still live with me.

However, my son has no where to go. He has been couch surfing from friend‚Äôs house to friend‚Äôs house since his release and has had some trouble finding work.

Her mother (my fianc√©‚Äôs first wife) passed away 2 years ago from cancer. I met my fianc√© while he was married but nothing romantic happened between us until after she passed.

Anyways, recently she told my fianc√© that she‚Äôd like to read a poem at our wedding during the speech portions. It‚Äôs one based on loss and family, and is quite a nice poem, but she‚Äôd like to publicly dedicate it to her late mom with a short speech after. 

I read the draft of it and am incredibly unhappy with how it sounds. Essentially she wants to talk about how happy her dad and her mom used to be while she was alive, and how their marriage was the stuff of fairy tales. She ends it with a ‚ÄúI hope [me and my fiance] will have a fairy tale of their own‚Äù which is a nice sentiment if that was only thing she‚Äôs reading. Basically, I feel like she‚Äôd be using our wedding to reminisce how my fianc√©‚Äôs last marriage was the unobtainable stuff of fairytales and I‚Äôd just be lucky to get a tiny piece of what they had. It sure feels like a intentional jab towards me.

I get that she‚Äôs still grieving and she‚Äôs a kid and all that. But I really don‚Äôt want this read at our wedding, which I want to be a celebration of new beginnings, not death or grief or ex wives. I‚Äôve talked to my fianc√© and he sees 100% NOTHING wrong with the speech which has frankly upset me beyond what I‚Äôd imagined. I feel like he‚Äôs insisting on prioritizing her during a day that should be about me and him ONLY, not his kid or ex.

I‚Äôve mulled over asking her directly to cut the speech portion and just read the poem, perhaps with a nice ‚Äúdedicated to my mom‚Äù at the end and nothing more. AITA if I do this or something similar?",1

"AITA for not ‚ÄòSharing the wealth‚Äô | For one thing, I am in no ways rich. I‚Äôm twenty years old and only recently came into a well-paying job and got smarter with my spending. 

I‚Äôve had a friend since junior year of high school, who whenever we would go out and I was strapped for cash, would often pay my bill. Wether it be for a bite to eat or going mini-golfing/bowling or whatever. He always expected payments which I would always pay back. When I couldn‚Äôt pay him back in a time he considered acceptable, he would berate me, saying that I waste all my money on my girlfriend or that I‚Äôm not wise with how I spend my money on my car, albeit car payment, basic upkeep, as well as some personal upgrades (but it‚Äôs my damn money, after all). 

Recently he himself has a new relationship with a woman who herself has no job, a massive amount of college debt, and a spending problem. He has lost most of his savings because of it, and I have sat on the sidelines with my mouth shut, for fear of him throwing it back in my face. A few nights ago, he told me he was going up to her college (about a four hour drive) and asked if he could borrow some gas money (nothing too huge, about $50-$60). But I denied him, as I thought back to all the times he would berate me for asking him. I didn‚Äôt call him out, or tell him he‚Äôs spending too much money, or nothing. I‚Äôm currently all paid up to him and I feel as though he has his money and I have mine. 

TLDR; My friend asks for money. I deny him because he would berate me if I asked him to do the same. AITA?

EDIT: I have PayPaled him $60. He‚Äôs up at his GFs college so it‚Äôll be some gas money for the trip home. I still don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm the A-hole, but paying him did give me a little peace of mind. He was there for me and I should be there for him. I won‚Äôt berate him or ask for it back, frankly I don‚Äôt care that much about it.",1

I get to the car first, I ask my grandad if he wants to sit in the front, he says no, so I get in the front. My mum gets in the car (drivers seat) and tells me to get in the back so her boyfriend can sit in the front.

I‚Äôm like nah, why can‚Äôt he sit in the back? I got here to the car first, I‚Äôm your first child, and he‚Äôs not my dad. It‚Äôs not personal, I just want to sit in the front and that‚Äôs where my butt is so I‚Äôm not getting out. 

Anyway I refused to get out, my grandad called me a stubborn brat, and my mums boyfriend got in the car huffing and puffing like an arsehole. It‚Äôs kinda awkward in the car now.

"WIBTA for trying to make up with a person that probably doesn't wanna see me? | So this is the short story. 

I was really into this girl, but I overstepped by showing too much persistance. I asked her out 3 times, she said no all 3. The last time she got really mad at me, like really really mad. I felt bad and I felt like an asshole. I decided to cut all contact with her, but 6 months later I still feel shitty and I want to call her (with no intent to try out with her again, just call her to ask how she is/etc).

"WIBTA if I moved out of my boyfriends house and bought my own? | For some background my boyfriend and I have been dating nearly a year. He co-owns a house with a grandparent and I moved in almost three months ago when my lease ended. I initially planned on buying my own house but got laid off. I now have a new well paying job. 

My boyfriend basically lived with me from the beginning and I didn‚Äôt mind. I was invited to his house but rarely accepted because I feel most comfortable in my own place and like privacy. 

As mentioned before this house is co-owned with his grandmother. That is fine with me. My sticking point is getting annoyed with freeloading family members. He has two adult relatives who work (one works 60 hours a week) who won‚Äôt even pay the minimal amount he asked for (1/4 of what renting an apartment would cost). 

It irks me beyond belief to be paying rent for a house I don‚Äôt own while other adults live there for free. I don‚Äôt want to not pay but I feel like I‚Äôm subsidizing their housing. And it‚Äôs not my house. To be honest I don‚Äôt like sharing a house with other people and the rent issue magnifies that for me. 

So, would I be the asshole if I told my boyfriend I want to buy my own house? I never mentioned it being temporary when he asked me to move in but he did know I wanted my own house.",0

"AITA for continuing to cook prawns in shared uni kitchens after my neighbor complained about the smell | I‚Äôm in university accommodation and live on a floor with 9 other girls. We all share a kitchen which is located at the end of the corridor. Most people don‚Äôt cook very much, since there is a canteen nearby serving breakfast lunch and dinner. I tend to cook a lot to save money, and also because the canteen food is very repetitive and not particularly healthy. 


One thing i cook quite often is korean bbq prawns, i make it maybe 2-3 times a week. I‚Äôm not pescatarian exactly but I‚Äôm quite fussy about meats so I end up eating mostly fish and seafood, with the occasional beef or pork. 
A few weeks ago one of my neighbors told me i need to stop cooking with prawns because it makes her room smell for hours (her room is right next to the kitchen). I knew it made the kitchen smell bit i didn‚Äôt think it bothered anyone since most people only go in there to make tea or heat up microwave food- as I said most people eat in the canteen and the kitchen is too small to be used as a social space. 

Obviously I felt bad that she could smell it from her room, but I also didn‚Äôt want to have to change my diet because of it. I told her to just open her windows and get some air freshener. 

She didn‚Äôt talk to me again for a few weeks so I assumed the issue had been resolved, until I found out she asked to be moved to a different room but was told there were none available. 

She‚Äôs now demanding that I switch rooms with her, since I‚Äôm the one causing the problem. I don‚Äôt want to do that though. Partially because her room has a an opposite mirror image to mine (for the layout and furniture) and i would feel weird in an opposite room. And also because I don‚Äôt want my room to smell like prawns either, to be honest. 

Does that make me a dick? I was assigned this room so nobody can force me to move. I‚Äôm also perfectly within my right to cook prawns, (I don‚Äôt leave the kitchen in a mess or anything, unlike some of the other girls)


Edit: jeeeesus christ have any of you even been a student ever? do you have any idea the amount of shit you have to put up with when you live in close quarters with a bunch of 18 year olds?? the showers are fucking disgusting, people leave their trash out in the corridor when they can‚Äôt be fucked taking it down to the bins, food gets stolen from the fridges, there‚Äôs almost always somebody playing loud music, people have room parties or make stupid amounts of noise coming home late... i don‚Äôt think i owe it to everyone to stop making prawns any more than we all owe it to each other to respect the accommodation‚Äôs code of conduct. and at least i‚Äôm genuinely NOT breaking a single rule with my fucking PRAWNS",1

"AITA for being rude to my cousin after she was rejected from her dream university and I got in? | So this happened last month. Me (18f) and my cousin (18f) both applied to the same highly prestigious university, it's the best in the UK & one of the best in the world. I'm not saying that to gloat about the fact I got in but because it explains why going there is a much bigger deal than any other uni. It might also be important to mention that our dad's are brothers and do not get on very well and our grandparents are closer to my dad.

We both applied. She got rejected. I got in. The next week, we were at our grandparents and she seemed visibly upset with me. I let this slide, the uni had been her dream for far longer than it had been mine. Throughout the day, her and her parents kept rolling their eyes whenever my acceptance got mentioned. Eventually over dinner, my grandfather gave a toast to my acceptance to the uni AND her acceptance to her second choice uni. 

At this point, she ran out crying and I followed her because even though we're not close I wanted to see if she's okay. She said it was unfair I got accepted because I don't work as hard as her and that she's wasted years of her life on getting into this uni and it's been ruined by people like me.

This took me by surprise. I'll admit I do juul, drink, and smoke weed recreationally but I still work exceptionally hard. Both academically and recreationally. I told her that I do in fact work harder and that maybe she simply wasn't as good as she thought. I also said that it was not my fault she had no social life, she choose that.

I think I might be TA for saying those things to her while she was upset. AITA for telling her what I though or should I have left it?",1

"AITA for not accepting rejection? | I'm cutting to the point, i don't like getting rejected. the moment a girl rejects me any relationship or connection we have is dead to me. I know its harsh, but it's the truth. Ever since I started being interested in girls, all they do is reject me or ""see me as a brother"", Im not interested in sticking around for that tbh. It happened to me last week, with a girl i thought I had a chance of getting with. It crushed me, and i blocked her everywhere. One of her friends went up to me a few days later and got in my face about how i'm immature and how I threw her away and don't value her.

I just walked away from her. I'm so fucking sick of this shit happening to me, rejection is fucking horrific at this point, and all I get for not accepting it is shit. I don't even lash out, i just do what's best for everyone and cut contact with them, and still I get shit on for ""not valuing them"" and shit. I just don't want to waste my time and energy on lost causes. Anyway, are they right? Am I an asshole who doesnt value girls?

Edit: didnt expect this huge reaction. apparently i'm an asshole because I think it's ridiculous for girls to expect friendship after basically shitting all ofer you, and that they are then entitled to ruin your reputation if you disregard them from that point on. I expected some blowbakc, but not such a united front against torturing yourself after already getting assfucked by rejection

"AITA for getting a homeless man kicked out of library? | The way I see it,  I had every right to do what I did,  but it might have been a dick move. I go to a State College in a city that has a pretty large homeless population. I'm pulling an all-nighter in the school's library and trying to get some work done. It's 3:00 am right now, and I've been in here for about eight hours. The library closes at 6:00 pm, but the lobby remains open 24/7 for students. You need a student ID to get in. So around 9:00 pm, this homeless dude walked in and laid down on this couch/seat thing in front of me. I didn't give a shit, there was at least fifteen other students in here and he wasn't bothering anyone. About an hour later, he started snoring pretty loudly so I put some headphones on and just kept working. At like 3am I get up to use the bathroom when suddenly I realized it was just me and him in here. I didn't really like the idea of that, have had some bad experiences in the past.  He looked like a rough dude, albeit kind of adorable all cuddled up snoring like fucking obese bulldog. He never said or did anything to me, but I started worrying he would wake up and try to do something. So I went in the bathroom and made a call to Campus PD, and ten minutes later they came and kicked him out. I feel kind of bad now. The dude was just trying to get some sleep. Am I the asshole?

We have been dating for awhile now and she‚Äôs always been courteous in asking to eat or use my stuff, she doesn‚Äôt eat much so I always gave her the okay. After she had spent a week at my place I told her she doesn‚Äôt have to ask me to eat my food on day 3 since she would always ask before she ate, she doesn‚Äôt eat much since she‚Äôs smaller but I didn‚Äôt take into account that a handful of granola, a bowl of yogurt, and a banana every day would stack up after awhile. She left my place after the stay and now every time she comes and stays for a period of time she eats my food. I feel bad for wanting her to start buying her own groceries to keep at my place since she consistently takes me out for food, buys me clothes, contributes to groceries when we cook, and keeps my weed supply full. I can‚Äôt comfortably afford to be feeding one and a half me‚Äôs so often though since she‚Äôs here at minimum 2 days a week. She has brought up in the past the fact that she feels I don‚Äôt take her out enough but we have a quiet understanding that she makes more than me since she works 5-6 days a week and I work 3 (not by my choice). I feel like she contributes a lot monetarily to the relationship and in terms makes her feel like she contributes more emotionally in the relationship because she‚Äôs always making sure I‚Äôm taken care of and comfortable. I don‚Äôt know if I should just suck it up because she‚Äôs not taking much from me and if I‚Äôd be wrong or an asshole to expect someone who gives so much to give me more. WIBTA?

"AITA for calling out a wedding guest for dressing too showy? | Throwaway account. This happened this past weekend.

I was a bridesmaid at a wedding where the dress code was black tie optional. 

The guest in question was an old family friend of the groom, and she was probably in her mid 20s. While her dress was not overly formal or risque, it was very glamorous and attention grabbing. It's hard to describe, but she was wearing a sparkly blue cocktail dress that was probably designer, and stilletto heels that were absolutely designer. Her hair and makeup was also so perfect, it must have been done by a professional. Honestly, she looked like she walked off the red carpet of a movie premiere. 

She was certainly grabbing attention. During the cocktail hour many, many guests (none of whom know her) approached her to rave about her outfit. The bride noticed and while she didn't say anything, I could tell she was bothered by the split attention. 

At the reception, I ran into her in the bathroom and made a comment like ""nice outfit, but who are you trying to impress here? You're just a random guest."" She told me to mind my business and she left. I retold this story back at the table, and while a couple bridesmaids were on my side, some thought I was too harsh.

"AITA for snapping at my boyfriend after he suggested the source of my chronic pain? | I [F25]have had pain my hip for more than ten years. I‚Äôve seen many specialists and had numerous tests/scans done but they never found the root of the problem. My boyfriend [M25] is well aware of my occasional pain episodes. He‚Äôs been my human walking stick during the worst flair-ups and I am thankful for his support. 

Today, we were supposed to go out to an outdoor event that involves a lot of walking. I messaged him in the morning telling him how I couldn‚Äôt sleep last night cause the pain was so bad and that I could barely walk. He replied asking if I wore tight pants. I was confused and thought he was joking. I call him and made fun of this theory thinking it was meant to be a joke. But he‚Äôs serious and says I should try wearing loose pants. He keeps insisting this pants theory because ‚Äúall [my] pants are too tight‚Äù. I become pretty pissed because he has made several comments about my ‚Äútight‚Äù pants in the past, usually as a jab at my weight. I explained this to him adding that I am insulted he would use my chronic pain as a way to criticize my weight. He says he was just trying to help by giving me a solution and that I‚Äôm being too sensitive.

He says that if I don‚Äôt want these suggestions, then I shouldn‚Äôt complain or mention my pain. 

AITA for being mad at him over his attempts to help?

EDIT: for those who are asking, yes I did listen to him and his concerns. I explained that there was no correlation between the pants I wore and my pain. He also sent me an article on tight pants neuritis and I read through it. The pain described is very different from what I experience.

"AITA for ""refusing food"" from my teenage daughter? | TLDR at the bottom, on mobile, not a native speaker.

So this happened before the schools closed, but we still argue about it and I thought I could ask for your opinion, Reddit. 

I (f41) have custody of my son (m6) and my daughter (f15) whom we'll call Lila for this story. They both live with me, and they visit their dad, my ex, each weekend.

Lila is a freshman in high school. She doesn't actually have a lot of homework, just a bit, maybe 1 hour total. 

When she comes home from school (3:30PM) she usually wants to relax first and eat before doing her homework. A couple of months ago I started making her do her homework right away, and eat after it.

Lila doesn't like it, and complains about it, but I told her she's being dramatic. Normal, rebellious teenagers am I right? She says she comes home hungry and eating a bit would help her be more focused and give her more energy.

I on the other hand think that Lila should do the homework right away, because the information is still fresh in her mind, and then she wouldn't have to worry about it when it's done. Also food is a great motivator so she'll get the work done quickly. It's not like I'm starving her or anything, I just think it's a good method.

Lila apparently told her dad that I don't let her eat before homework is done. And now he's mad at me, saying it's ""not healthy to refuse food"" and that ""she could develop an eating disorder"". I think she's being a dramatic, nitpicking teenage girl, and her dad is just blindly taking her side.

So what do you think, Reddit? Who sucks here?

TLDR: I don't let daughter eat before she's done her homework, now her dad is complaining.

EDIT: Yes, she was getting good grades and doing her homework anyways, but I just figured it's better for her to get to relax in the evening when all the homework is done.",1
"AITA for using the female toilets? | Pretty simple question really. Male toilet was out of order at work, disabled toilet was, and I couldn't be bothered to go down the stairs to the floor below so I used the female one.

"AITA for being furious over niece meeting her dad without me knowing | I‚Äôm raising my niece. She‚Äôs 10. Her mom OD‚Äôed when she was 4 and her dad has never been officially named. There‚Äôs always a rumor about it being ‚ÄúTim Scott‚Äù.

We live in a small town so he‚Äôs always been around but she never expressed interest in meeting him. She knew about the Tim Scott guy from her mom but never even mentioned him to me. 



Anyway, my niece recently goes to a birthday party at her friend Kate‚Äôs house. Kate‚Äôs dad and I are not close friends but he was very close to my sister prior to her drug addiction so the girls have been friends since birth. I had to work the day of the party so her babysitter dropped her off. 



I go to pick her up and she‚Äôs in a secluded area, sitting down with Tim Scott. I asked Kate‚Äôs dad what is going on and he says he asked niece if she wanted to meet Tim Scott, she said yes, so he called him up and told him to come over. 



I was furious with Kate‚Äôs dad. It just seemed like such a boundary to cross. I‚Äôm not saying I wouldn‚Äôt let her meet him but there‚Äôs so much we need to talk about first. 


Tim Scott was nice about it i suppose. She said he just asked her what sports she plays and about school. Kate‚Äôs dad gave him our Number(wtf?).

"AITA for not letting the mother of my daughter visit her unless she pays me $20,000? | I have a 16 year old daughter and I became a single father at 19. The mother, my girlfriend at the time, became pregnant and didn't want to keep the child. We can argue about abortion or whatever but I urged her not to. I am pro-choice but when it was my own child on the line, I had a change of heart. I was a dumb teen but I don't regret my actions. 

We paid her and her family $20,000 to bring the pregnancy to term and relinquish parental rights. She jumped for joy at this so we thought we ""won"" but throughout the whole pregnancy she threatened to go get a termination or sign our kid over for adoption. After a while we broke up because she was being very dark and manipulative, trying to squeeze more money out of our deal.

To make a long story short, she ended up bringing the baby to term, signed away her parental rights, and I became lone guardian of a daughter. Over the years I never mentioned her mother to her anything but the facts: her mother didn't want to have a child so she left and her mother was abusive to me during the pregnancy. We only told her when she was old enough, too.

Mother contacts me through Facebook two weeks ago asking if she can visit her daughter. This is our first communication in 16 years. She never expressed interest in rejoining her life, we basically stopped talking a day after she was born. I asked my daughter who is old enough to make her own decisions on what to do, and she said she has no interest. Just to stop the conversation because I know she'd say no, I told my ex she could visit if she paid us the $20,000 back.

"AITA for not wanting to watch the dog I bought for my GF? | Context: I have my own place, my gf shares an apartment with her friend. She's on her school summer break and has taken up a job, she has mentioned that she wants a dog (this breed in paticular) and she's lead me to believe that she would be able to take care of one.


I bought my current gf of 2 months a $700 puppy (+ food, a dog bed, some toys etc) for her birthday. It's been a week and she seems to be having troubles managing her schedule and making time for the dog. 


She has asked me to look after him last tuesday just for a few hours and I happily accepted. She asked me again on Thursday and I said ok. Today her ROOMMATE texted me, asking me if I could pick the pup up from her house after I got off work, I didn't want this to turn into a norm where we're both taking care of the dog like some divorced parents taking turns with their child so I told her I couldn't.


I usually wait until after work to look at texts from people I dont really care about so by the time I texted her roommate back she was already out and the barely trained puppy was home alone. She told me she left 2 hours ago and that my girl told her she could ask me to take care of the dog if she was going go head out. I was pretty upset and I told sorry I can't. 

Half an hour later I got a text from my gf and she was pretty upset with me. She knew I wasnt busy and I had no plans tonight so she was pretty pissed off I couldn't go take care of her dog. I told her I bought it for her and that I never wanted to responsibility of looking after and training a dog. After a little back and forth she hung up on me. 


Like bitch really? You're the one that wanted a dog. I am nowhere near the point in life where I want to be raising anything resembling a kid. She probably thinks I'm an asshole but I bought HER (not me) a fucking 700 dollar dog that shes always wanted. I just want some third party feedback before I try to talk to her about this.


Tl;dr:  I bought my gf a dog she has always wanted and shes asked me to take care of her 3 times this week and I said yes to the first 2 times. But I dont want to be looking after the dog anymore cause I'm not the one that wanted a dog.

Edit: I dont mean bitch as a word filled with ill intent. Bitch is a word that's in our vocabulary and carries little weight. ""Bitch really"" is just a playful phrase that is not offensive to her. Apologies for the misunderstanding.",1
"AITA for spending good money on a magic set? | I went to a ski trip at school recently (15M) and my parents gave me a $200 prepaid card for necessities on the trip like food and stuff.  However my friends kept treating me to things during the trip so I only wound up spending like $30 on food. Also my friends lent me some of their extra skiing stuff so I didn‚Äôt need to buy my own warning pads etc. 

Anyway on the way back I was browsing on my phone and saw this cool magic set. I‚Äôve wanted to be a magician for a while, maybe not as a full career but at least part time. So I bought it. It was $150. So I gave the card back to my parents with $20 on it. They were fine with this. 

When the magic set arrived my parents got upset because apparently it‚Äôs a waste of money (tell that to David Blaine) and they gave me food money not ‚Äúmagic money.‚Äù But if they never knew it was spent on the magic set they would of been fine with it? It was very bizarre honestly. They even told me it would of been fine if I spent the full $200 and I didn‚Äôt even do that.

"AITA for not attending my SO's family gathering until his nephew got checked out for autism | Very recently, my SO (40m) started bringing me (25f) and my kid (5m) from a previous relationship, to their family gatherings. Now he has a nephew (7m) who's obese and does not talk at all. I met the kid's family already but this is the first time I am bringing my kid.

My kid is a friendly child while on the other hand, the nephew is kind of a bully. I mean everyone in the family admits to it. Naturally, my kid went to the kid to play. At first, they were playing ok but after 15 minutes my kid came to me crying saying that the nephew pushed him over. I brushed it off at first and told my kid that it was an accident. He understood so he came back to the nephew to play again. After an hour, my kid came to me and said he's scared to go near my SO's nephew because he presses his weight on him and that my son couldn't breathe while he sits on top of him. The nephew is more than double my kid's weight.

I told what happened to my SO and he said that that's just how his nephew horse around. He said that he's like that when he becomes fond of the kid he plays with. I told my SO that I am not ok with that but he looked at me like I was overreacting. I also told the mother of the nephew what happened but she just shrugged it off and basically told me that my kid's fine and they were just playing. Every one in my So's family seem to think that the kid is okay but to me, he needs help.

Now the kid is already 7 but does not speak at all. He just gestures for whatever he wants. Also, the fact that he pushes people around and sits on top of them got me thinking that the kid could have a spectrum of autism. Of course that is not for me to diagnose so I told my SO that they need to get the kid checked so we'll know what type of care he needs. Until then, I refuse to bring my kid to any family gatherings if I knew the nephew will be there. My SO and his family think that I am a dick because I don't trust them and this is a huge deal-breaker for us.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I asked my SO why the kid is not speaking at his age but they all didn't know. So no diagnosis yet. The kid has not been checked for anything and they solution for it is to have the kid enrolled in a school so he can have some sort of an interaction. I don't know how well he does in the school. I just want SO's nephew to have all the help that he needs so he can grow normal. We all have to admit that any 7 y/o that is completely silent and is not deaf, isn't normal.

Also, I appreciate all the replies.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: I am a female. Sorry, that was a typo.

&#x200B;

EDIT 3: We live in the Philippines.

&#x200B;

EDIT 4: Again, the fact that he pushes people around and sits on top of them got me thinking that the kid could have a spectrum of autism. Of course that is not for me to diagnose so I told my SO that they need to get the kid checked so we'll know what type of care he needs. Until then, I refuse to bring my kid to any family gatherings if I knew the nephew will be there.

I am not saying that he gets tested specifically for Autism, I am only saying that he needs to have medical intervention so we'll know how we can help the nephew further to be better. Also, I do not want to bring my kid anymore because my son is the only kid there within the nephew's age group and I don't want him to feel isolated because my son is scared of going near him.

&#x200B;

EDIT 5: Again, I am not saying/diagnosing that the kid has autism. I am simply implying that they got him checked out by a medical practitioner, not just for autism; because the kid never had any medical intervention.",0

"WIBTA if I quit an unpaid job right before it began for a paid one? | I applied for and was accepted to a summer camp earlier this year. My mom required me to work this summer and it was all I could find. The camp is unpaid and 40 hours a week.

I just got an email about a camp that teaches one of my hobbies. I was recommended by another hobbiest I know. The camp is paid and 35 hours a week.

The paid camp wants to interview me this afternoon. The unpaid camp is supposed to have a a meeting tonight. I would probably know if I 100% had the job before the meeting.

If I 100% have the paid job, I'd like to quit the unpaid one in favor of it. I not, I would attend the unpaid meeting and continue to act like I'll work until I know for sure.

"AITA for accidentally making my daughter believe her uncle's brightly colored vegan cake was Play-doh and causing the entire family to do arts and crafts with it instead of eating it? | At a family Christmas brunch my brother had done his absolute best preparing a vegan dessert for the family. He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn‚Äôt help it‚Ä¶ it just‚Ä¶ looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don‚Äôt know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it‚Ä¶

Now I‚Äôve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúPapa, what is that?‚Äù and I just, blurted out‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Play-doh, baby!‚Äù

So, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some ‚Äúclay to play with‚Äù, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother‚Äôs dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails‚Ä¶ the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother‚Äôs dessert. He wasn‚Äôt too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches‚Äô vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.

**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.",1

"AITA for saying my cousin doesn‚Äôt deserve to get an iPhone for Christmas? | This has been going on for a few days, I‚Äôm not directly part of the main argument but my family and I have been discussing it.
So my cousin (10M) is a hothead who doesn‚Äôt listen to his parents, and overall just very irresponsible. My aunt and uncle think so too, so when he started begging for a new iPhone 11 for Christmas, they did not purchase him one. My mom and grandmother felt bad for him and sort of hinted that maybe they should get him one. I, however, did NOT want my cousin to get a phone. He already has a tablet and an Xbox that he plays on all the time, anyway.
When he opened up his gifts on Christmas Day and saw that he didn‚Äôt get the phone, he absolutely lost his mind (I wasn‚Äôt there for this, but my grandmother gave us the story). He immediately said he hated all of his gifts and stormed out of the room, saying that his parents didn‚Äôt love him. My uncle had tears in his eyes.
Now here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm the asshole:
My mom, grandmother and I were talking about the situation and whether or not my aunt and uncle were correct in not getting him the phone. We all agreed that it was probably for the best, but they were extremely sympathetic towards him. Hearing that made me pretty angry if I‚Äôm being honest - I got my first phone when I was 12, a crappy old thing, and once I proved I could take care of it and was responsible, then I got a better one. I told them that I didn‚Äôt feel an ounce of sympathy towards my cousin and that he did not deserve to get a phone, especially since he acted horribly when he realized he didn‚Äôt get it. They told me that I was overreacting, that I wasn‚Äôt thinking about his feelings in the matter and perhaps he would learn responsibility through taking care of the phone. They also said that the rules in my house are not the same as in their house, so I shouldn‚Äôt compare my experience on getting a phone to his.
So I‚Äôm not sure, AITA for my reaction to this whole thing? I confess that I wasn‚Äôt very nice about it, if my cousin/aunt & uncle heard me talking I‚Äôm sure they would‚Äôve been upset.",0

I was really pissed off and said dude, this is a first date, I‚Äôm not your therapist. I don‚Äôt care about you at all‚Äù. He got pissed and said you ‚Äúwanted to me know me better, so why are you getting pissy when I‚Äôm giving something you asked. 

Things were getting pretty heated at that point and he left since people were starting to look.

"AITA for getting drunk at a concert and ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù my s/o and their younger sibling? | Sorry for the long post and weird format, I‚Äôm on mobile. 

A couple nights ago, I went to a concert with the above mentioned. It was the first concert I‚Äôve been to since I got a considerable raise at my job, so having the extra money was nice. I bought some merch and decided to drink. Quite a bit. Well, before the headliner came on, I went outside and sat down since all of the alcohol was setting in. I ended up passing out for about 10-15 mins at a time, and my s/o came out a few times to get me to move; I told them that I couldn‚Äôt because I would‚Äôve thrown up, and they said I was embarrassing them so I apologized. Well, the concert ended and we all walked to my car, I got in the back seat to lie down and my s/o drove for about 5 minutes before I had them pull over for me to throw up. I apologized again and we headed home. Once we got home, I grabbed all the stuff from the concert and went inside, setting it down before going to take a shower. I bent some of the posters we got and my s/o got mad at me for it, so I again apologized for it. They‚Äôve done some embarrassing things before, so I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm fully in the wrong here. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated!

Edit: thank you to everyone that has commented so far. I finally realized that I am fully in the wrong and I accept it. I talked with my s/o last night, apologized sincerely, and they forgave me. I will take all of your comments and remember them the next time I go out and drink.",1

"AITA for telling people my dog is a rescue when he's not? | I have a 5 year old Border Collie (BC) who I adopted as a puppy from a Craigslist ad. To my knowledge he came from a happy home. 

For a first time dog parent I was proud of the amount of time and effort I put into socializing and training BC, and for the first 3 years of his life we were happy as could be. I felt incredibly lucky to have such easy going and eager to please first dog. 

Unfortunately 2 years ago at house party BC had a traumatizing encounter with a child that has caused him to become incredibly nervous and aggrey towards children. In retrospect I should have gotten him into training and addressed the trauma immediately. Instead I avoided children and he quarantined BC in a no-kids area when children were around. 

I recently moved and have started to take BC out and about to dog parks or to explore. BC is a handsome pup with ""hey -- you're my best friend in the whole world!"" energy so we're often approached, especially by children in his high-risk age group. 

When approached I usually something along the lines was of ""Oh, he doesn't like kids"", but half of the time the parent or child will just respond that it's okay, they're good with dogs and then they get snarled at. 

I was complaining to a friend with a rescue who's aggressive towards children as well and they said that they didn't have that experience becuase when they tell people their dog's a rescue and doesn't like kids trauma is assumed. 

When parents approach with there children I now say ""Sorry, he doesn't like kids he's a rescue"" then do the SNL Debbie Downer grimace, and it has decreased the number of snarling at kids incedents to almost never. 

Am I an asshole for telling people BC is a rescue when he isn't becuase I want my child aggression warning to be taken seriously?",0

"AITA for getting tired of my daughter's complaining about her childhood? | My adopted daughter had her first child about six months ago and very shortly after entered a major depressive episode. She's struggled with depression all her life and at this point in time it's gotten near impossible to function. I've been helping her out immensely-she moved back in, I pay for her living, and she's working on taking care of herself and working to a place where she can handle things like other people and a job again, while getting on medication for her depression. It's going well, she's working hard to get more stable, and it feels like starting over again as a mother-I've always loved the baby stage best.

Since this my biological daughter has become bitchy and unpleasant. When I asked what was wrong, she told me she thought it was ""fucked up"" that I opted out of parenting both my children, sort of blaming me for their mental health, and then I play mother of the year for a baby that isn't mine. I let it go because to an extent I see her point. I was a young, single, working mother, so I didn't spend much time with either of my children. I wasn't the most mature or best equipped to handle them like I am now. I figured she would get over it if I let her vent.

She didn't get any happier or nicer, so I asked again. And again. And she kept complaining about her *terrible* childhood and how awful I was. Eventually I got sick of it and told her the reality-she was a problem child and I was in over my head trying to do my best. I had to handle her underage drinking, drug use, frequent arrests, and an expulsion and she never made it easy. She said that she hoped her sister got her act together before my grandchild gets old enough that I lose interest. That was my last straw and I told her to stop talking to me until she can be respectful and polite.

My husband (her step-father) has refused to take my side, going so far as to say I'm being disrespectful and I have to acknowledge I was a bad mom once. I feel like everyone is ganging up on me, and the only people who aren't mad at me are my adopted daughter and grandson.

"AITA for not wanting to go to my girlfriend's highschool prom? | I am a m(19) in my second year of college and my girlfriend is a f(17) in her junior year of high school(she does not attend my old highschool). 

My girlfriend and I recently had a fight over my decision to not attend her junior prom. My reasoning is that I feel uncomfortable going to a prom because I am too old(more than halfway done with my 4 year degree). Highschool prom seems like a long time ago for me, and I feel like I'm going back in time by dancing with highschoolers and being glared at by supervising teachers. I am worried about being that creepy college guy who came back to a kids junior prom to relive his glory days or something. I made my feelings clear to my gf at the beginning of our relationship about 5 months ago, and she agreed that it would be weird if I came. It wasn't until recently she told me that's not actually how she felt and was just saying that to not cause conflict.

My gf does not understand why I feel uncomfortable. One of her friends has a boyfriend about my age that is going to the prom, and she uses that as an example to tell me that it's normal. My girlfriend has been going through a lot recently, and she told me that this is the one thing she was looking forward to and now I'm ruining it for her. I have apologized to her for not being there for her at the prom and she has forgave me, but she told me she will ""never forget what I did"". 

I really like my gf and I really liked my prom back in the day. I feel bad that she can't enjoy her prom with me like she wants to. I've talked to friends my age, and I've received mix inputs. Most say that I should not go because it would be weird and I will look bad, while others say I should go and be there for her if I really like her.

We were there maybe 10 minutes, sat down, ordered drinks, and dad said he didn't want to order food yet because we were waiting for someone. We waited, and a woman showed up. Dad introduced her as our sister. My half sister was born about 6 months after me, meaning dad cheated on mum while they were married/my brother was a toddler/she was pregnant with me. I asked if we had any more siblings we didn't know about. Dad said ""I don't want to discuss that right now"", which is code for ""yup but you look mad right now"". I left without a word.

"WIBTA for suing a bankrupt lady over a bird? | TL;DR My parrot has a fatal, highly contagious disease and will die terribly and prematurely. The breeder knowingly sent him and other birds out diseased, infecting other birds in the process and killing them.

I received my parrot 8/11/19. He‚Äôs my first bird so I researched and bought from a breeder that had reviews and recommendations. He was missing feathers, but the breeder said that he‚Äôd been plucked by his siblings, not uncommon but she ought to have told me before shipping him. As his condition worsened, I had him tested for PBFD for $600. PBFD is a disease where parrots lose all their feathers, become immunosuppressed and their bodies necrotize and then they die of that or secondary illnesses. Kind of like AIDs for parrots. When he tested positive, I confronted the breeder to request a refund per the health guarantee. She told me her story. In text. Yeah, she‚Äôs not smart. She wasn‚Äôt the breeder but had bought the birds from a bird mill to resell them and make money. She had no idea they were all sick, and due to all the refunds she was now bankrupt and couldn‚Äôt refund me. She had to move her own parrots out in Jan because they might catch PBFD from the birds she‚Äôd had at her house. She knew the birds had PBFD since Jan, but didn‚Äôt tell me. I could‚Äôve saved the $600 from testing for his future vet bills. I still just requested a refund for what I paid for my bird. She doubled down on the bankrupt bit and stopped replying.

Because she didn‚Äôt inform me or other buyers, I posted on Facebook to warn others in case they had other birds. It‚Äôs a highly contagious disease, so they‚Äôre likely to get it and die prematurely. Someone reached out to me and let me know that this breeder had known about PBFD 7/28/19, weeks before even sending my bird out to me because my bird‚Äôs sibling that she bought tested positive. In short, she knowingly sent out diseased birds and spread an infectious disease. I love my bird and had bought him with the intention he‚Äôd live 30+ years as my companion. Furthermore, this virus has an extremely long lifespan, so if I ever want another parrot, I will have to fumigate my house and deep clean with harsh chemicals.

After a consultation with a lawyer, once my bird passes, I have a clear case to sue for intentional emotional distress, damages, vet costs, loss of companionship, and punitive damages. WIBTA if I sue somebody who was essentially really stupid and got scammed by a bird mill into buying/reselling diseased birds and subsequently went bankrupt? She made the decision to lie which was bad enough but then she knowingly sent out diseased birds. I feel bad she's bankrupt and I'm being told she's already suffered enough, it's not right of me to go after her. But I'm the one who has to watch my companion waste away and die in pain. Obviously I'll be euthanizing him when it gets to that point. Suing her is, in my view, justice. But my friends are split and say she‚Äôs already bankrupt and it‚Äôs ‚Äújust a bird‚Äù.

"AITA for not attending my sister's wedding because my wife was in labor? | The timeline on this one is kind of extended, sorry

October 2015 - Sister announces her engagement and sets the date for February 2017

January 2016 - my wife and I announce we're expecting a baby after 4 years of trying. We waited until after the first appointments so we could tell mother the due date - Sept 21. Now, our 6yo had been a month and a half early, and the doctor warned us it could very well be the case again, so we knew we probably wouldn't make it to the 21st. Sister immediately announces she's moved the wedding up to Sept 3rd, and the chaos ensues. My wife and I knew from the start if the wedding was so close to the due date, we probably wouldn't be able to make it. Neither Mother nor Sister handle this news well, and we argue for several months

July - mother agrees to take my daughter to the wedding and keep her over night so she can still be the flower girl.

August - Mother forgets this arrangement and says she and Dad want to party the night before so they didn't want to be responsible for a child. She told me I was expected to either stay the night, or drive out, drop her off the day of, and either drive back (4 hours round trip) or stay for the wedding. I told her my sister would unfortunately have no flower girl, as my wife is in prodromal labor and cannot make it to the bathroom without several contractions.

The week of the wedding, the entire family keeps blowing up my phone. Sister decided to make it an extended camping trip for the family and wedding party. My parents took 5 days off for the wedding, and spent that time trying a combination of yelling and guilt tripping to get me to go.

Sept 3 - the wedding proceeds and my wife and I are in the hospital (AGAIN) for a stress test because she has been having contractions for 3 hours. We hear nothing from the family.

Sept 7 - my wife is admitted into the hospital. The baby is born at 4:23am the next morning.

AITA for not attending the wedding without my wife?

Edit:: the reason this is coming up now is because my mom wants me to drive with across country to my sister so we can lay my dad's ashes to rest. I haven't spoken to my sister since my father's memorial service where she confronted me about missing her wedding. Mom says I need to be the bigger person and let it go because my sister was hurt.

Edit 2:: Just to be clear (not that it matters to me which pronouns you use, but I was advise to add this info here) both my wife and I are women. She carried both our children, so - while I hate to think so - maybe my parents view them as less than grandchildren.",0
"AITA for telling my neighbor I will not be using her wi-fi anymore? | So I have a neighbor whose wi-fi I use and give her like 10 bucks a month.  We have always been friendly.  The other morning I was going to the store and asked her if she needed anything.  At the beginning of this month I forgot to give her 10 bucks, I forget sometimes and she never made a big deal out of it.  So she tells me to pick her up eggs and milk at the store.  I did so, and knocked on her door 3 times that day to give her the milk and eggs.  Apparently she worked a double shift so she wasn't home  all day and evening.  No biggie.  Around 10 PM I got a hankering for some hard boiled eggs, so I boiled 5 eggs and had a tall glass of milk, HER eggs and milk.  I didn't expect her to knock on my door after 10, so I thought it was no big deal at all, I would run to the store in the morning and grab a fresh gallon of milk and eggs for her.  Well, she knocked on my door at 10:30 PM, and I gave her the milk and eggs I got into because I thought she needed them.  She was livid that I gave her eggs with 5 missing and the opened gallon of milk, and walked away from my door saying some pretty nasty things.  I have never heard her talk that way before, and after thinking about it, I went over to her apartment and gave her back the wi-fi extender she gave me for her wi-fi.  She was pissed and called me an ass.  AITA for getting into the milk and eggs?",1
"AITA for not bumping a student's grad by 2% | Okay, so I was doing my student teaching and at the very end of the year, the last time I would see the class before their final, the student Bill was upset that he was getting only 88% and felt he deserved an A.

&#x200B;

This is high school sophomore English. He had received +90% on his essays and projects through the term, but had a \~60% on participation and classwork. Projects and essay were weighted in the gradebook, but in spite of that, Bill still was at a B.

&#x200B;

I explained that his behavior in class (frequently being on his phone, distracting neighbors, randomly yelling ""Timmy time"" during class) impacted others and showed that he wasn't interested in the class. He tried to argue things like that since he turned in the final draft, he shouldn't be penalized for not doing any of the pre-work or the rough draft.

&#x200B;

I decided to let him write an essay that explains why he deserves an A and that I would bump his grade. I want to stress this part while I said that the essay would need to be in MLA style, I did not specify that I would be deciding this based on the content of the essay. I sort of felt that writing an essay is an extra credit task, doesn't need too much scaffolding.

&#x200B;

Last day of school, Bill turns in an essay that was not in MLA style.  I glance at it, but don't read it and tell him I will put it in the gradebook. Bill did not stay, and its probably a good thing. His essay had two main arguments: participation should not be a factor in grading and only end products should be considered and that I, being visually impaired, cannot assess a class accurately on participation.

&#x200B;

Needless to say he did not get an A. But am I the A-hole? Does it seem like I broke a verbal agreement with the student and cheated him out of an A? Saw Bill on public transit the other day and it was AWKWARD.

&#x200B;

"AITA for accusing my Gf of faking ( over dramatising) a seizure when we went to the mall? | I've(31m) been with my gf  Charlotte (24 f) for 2 years Charlotte had epilepsy as a baby and child but hasn't had a fit since she was 6 years old. Now as a baby Charlotte had a traumatic brain injury at around 8 months old when her brother accidentally pulled a book case down on her, it partially caved in her skull which left her in a coma for 2 months, but she recovered well.

it's important to mention these 2 things because despite a rough start with the injury and she has had no trouble or seizures since. 

She gets migraine headaches but that may be unrelated.

so, this morning, we decided to go to the local mall for some bits and pieces, we split up and went to seperate shops.

half an hour later Charlotte calls my cell crying asking where i am.
I told her to calm down and tell me where she is, she said she was really confused and described what shops were nearby, i went to meet her and she was still crying.

She said she was in the middle of the shop when suddenly she didnt know where she was.
it's hard to describe it like she did because it was gibberish. She said its like she suddenly woke up in the store and had no idea how she got there and had no idea how long she had been there. from one second shopping and then suddenly finding herself standing in the store, i asked her what the last thing she remembered was but she said she wasn't sure because everything felt surreal. She said it was the strangest feeling but what bothered her most was that she felt like she had been in the store for hours despite suddenly finding herself there? are you seeing the holes in her logic yet?

Charlotte asked me to take her home because her vision went blurry like it dose before she gets a migraine, we drove home and ill admit i was a little pissed off because this is the first day off I've had in ages and i didn't get chance to get anything.

When we were home Charlotte took her migraine medicine and called her doctor and got an appointment for tomorrow morning but was advised to go to the hospital if her migriane got worse. Anyway it eased up with the codiene and she went to sleep. When she woke up she said she thinks it may have been a type of seazure, now im not a doctor obviously but i know what a seazure looks like and this sounds nothing like a seazure, she didn't faint or spasm or injure herself.

she literally just spaced out in the store and had what sounds like a major panic attack that we had to drop our shopping and dinner plans for.

i wasn't expecting her to blow up about it, but she said i was being a complete jerk. she isn't the attention grabbing type but i think it might have been like a pre migriane panic attack but she completely denies this saying she literally seemed to wake up in the store.

she has gone to lay back down because she feels sick after migraines and i do feek like a jerk but i don't think it was a seazure at all AITA",1

"AITA for declining a bridal shower invite? | One of my friends (word friend used loosely; we've never hung out one on one) invited me to her bridal shower. Let's call her friend A. I dont want to go to friend A's shower and declined the invitation because I'm not invited to her wedding. It wouldnt make sense for me to attend. Plus I know that this is just a gift grab (90+ women are invited to the shower). 

I dont dislike her or anything; i think she's a likeable person. I just find this kind of gesture inappropriate, disrespectful and distasteful. Plus, one of my former, closer ~friends~ , let's call her friend B, did something similar (invited me to her shower but excluded me from her wedding guest list. I didnt find out until after the shower). Friend B is also the one who asked me to come to Friend A's shower, knowing that I buy expensive gifts.

"AITA for criticizing my nephew even though he's my landlord? | My nephew rents out the basement to me, and it's gone to his head. He literally thinks I can't criticize him in any way. For example, today he told me he's going to buy a school bus that's been converted into a house on wheels. It'll cost $30,000 and he wants to live in it full time with his dogs. I asked him why he didn't just get an RV, and he said that they're poorly constructed when school bus companies go out of business from being so reliable and safe. I said this seemed ridiculous when he can just get a trailer for $10,000 and he said, ""I'm not really asking for your opinion. I'm just letting you know why we'll have a school bus in our driveway."" I told him to not get it since I don't want to have to park around it, and he said, ""You're not really in a position to tell me what to do. I'll park whatever I want in my driveway."" I told him that being a landlord's given him a ridiculous ego, and he told me that I'm just trying to control him. He then said the bus will be shipped here in April, and walked away. AITA? I don't think he should be immune from criticism just because he rents to me. This isn't the first time he acted like this. First it was with him buying a gaming desktop he didn't need, then a sporty Mazda.",1
"AITA for not wanting to give a close friend my free Coachella ticket for free? | One week before Coachella, I entered one of those ""tag your friend"" contests to win two VIP Coachella tickets for fun.

Keep in mind, I did not plan on going to Coachella at all due to being in debt and wanting to pay it off. But as luck would have it, I won that contest and found out that I would be going to Coachella 4 days before the event. The day I won was the day I started scrambling to change plans around and find whatever accommodations I needed for the weekend.

Because even physically going to Coachella is not cheap (lodging alone is pricey af) and not wanting to further go into debt, my boyfriend and I decided to intentionally sell our Sunday wristband to somehow make money back and keep costs as low as possible. That way we get to enjoy the free tickets and not spend too much money - a happy medium.

Turns out, my close gf wanted to go on Sunday very badly. So instead of selling the wristband to a stranger for a possible profit (I actually had someone offer to pay $375 for each wristband), I decided I would sell it to her because we are so close for cheaper than face value while at the same time recuperating some kind of cost from the trip.

Instead of what I thought would be a grateful response, she got incredibly offended that I would try to make any sort of money off of her despite selling it to her for less than face value. 1 Day VIP = \~$333 per wristband. I charged her $350 total for both wristbands so $175 each.

She claims that if it were her, she would have given them to me for free. I tried to tell her that not everyone is in the same financial situations or has the liberty to do that. And yes, she does know about my debt which I brought back up to her in this conversation. Thinking that would finally make her understand why I was charging her, she didn't and remained upset.

She works for a company that gives out free concert tickets in our hometown and brought up how she has taken me for free so I should give her these Coachella tickets for free which I thought was unfair because it costs at most gas money and parking to go to a concert in our hometown.

Even though she was mad at me, she still wanted to buy them from me; which felt weird because it wasn't like I was forcing her to buy it from me. I initially was going to charge her $400 but on the day she came to pick up the wristbands, I lowered the price to $350 as a gesture of good will. We made the exchange and she has not spoken to me since. To my knowledge, she still holds firm to her own belief that she is in the right because I should have given it to her for free because of our close friendship and because I got them for free anyways.

"WIBTA if I told my RA that my roommate never leaves the room? | Sorry, this is my first post on Reddit because I'm kind of concerned about my roommate. She's a freshman and at the beginning of the year, I thought she was really quiet and she was in the room a lot (she plays video games and watches Netflix, primarily), but I thought she was otherwise fairly typical. However, I recently found out that she switched all her classes to online versions of the class and that she's been eating frozen meals instead of going to the dining halls. I was recently sick for a couple of days (so just went to classes that had tests for an hour/1.5 hour) and then went straight back to my dorm. I don't think she left the dorm the entire time. I've tried inviting her out for food or just to hand out with friends, bust as far as I can tell, my question is not an exaggeration at all.

 I'm concerned because it can't be good for her physically or mentally to stay in our tiny room all the time. I'm hoping my RA would be able to tell me that she is already aware of this or she'd be able to refer my roommate to some help. At the same time, I feel like I might be tattling on her and as someone who is also pretty introverted, I can kind of understand why she doesn't want to leave. I'm also wondering if I'm partially motivated by the fact that I kind of want the room to myself for a bit.  WIBTA for telling my RA that my roommate never leaves the room?",0

"AITA for giving fashion advice on the first date? | FYI - posting for a friend that doesn‚Äôt have reddit, so this point on will be in their POV.

Hello Reddit! I (F34) was on a dating website and connected with an awesome guy (M33). We ended up going on a date and it was going pretty well. He was a great conversationalist, and we were able to connect on many topics quite well. Towards the end of the date, I mentioned ‚ÄúHey do you usually wear straight cut jeans? I think skinny jeans would look better on you.‚Äù He replied, ‚ÄúYou think so?‚Äù. I responded, ‚Äúyeah!‚Äù I didn‚Äôt think much of it and it ended pretty well, with a goodnight kiss :)

After the date he texted me goodnight and complimented me. After that he went ghost and I never reached out. After a few months he texted me and I asked him after going ghost why did he reach out? He answered, ‚ÄúYou started looking for flaws in me right after the very first date. Thought that happens after a few months.‚Äù Since then we‚Äôve been talking regularly, but a few of my friends have been saying I‚Äôm sort of an asshole for this situation. I didn‚Äôt think much of it and now I‚Äôm not too sure. Reddit, what do you think?

"AITA for not helping to clean the apartment at all? | We have a chore chart, everyone has a room. I do the kitchen, one of my roommates does the hallway, one does the living room, and another takes out the trash.

&#x200B;

I keep the kitchen spotless. Counters are constantly spotless, I buy new drip pans for the stove every 2-3 months, I load and unload the dishwasher 1-2 times a day and there are rarely dishes sitting in the sink for longer than 10 minutes after dinner. I also cook dinner for my roommates every night. I don't resent it - the kitchen is my baby, I love to cook, this isn't the problem for me. Hell - I insisted on these roles.

&#x200B;

Everyone else? It festers for 2-3 weeks until what would be 5 minutes of continuing maintenance work turns into a 3 hour cleaning session. This isn't me being a neat-freak to the point of dysfunction - you can barely walk through it when it gets bad.

&#x200B;

I am sick of it. I have sat them down several times (6 times) and told them I am feeling incredibly disrespected that I am expected to maintain the kitchen because rotting dishes are disgusting, yet they ask for my help every time they want to clean out the borderline hoarders nest that every other room turns into. I told them that the next time it happened? I wasn't helping them clean the other rooms - my job is constantly done, my kitchen is spotless, hell I clean up after \*them\* in the kitchen!

Last Saturday I was told we needed to clean. I walked out, gave the kitchen a once-over with a disinfectant wipe and went back to my room.

So my wife recently decided to quit her job to give birth to our triplets. Pregnancy has made her really insecure, paranoid and mental. She keeps shouting and crying for everything and it's driving me insane. 

So yesterday, she called me when I was at work and told me she was really ugly and I should find myself someone beautiful and better than her. I've told her many times not to call me at work unless it was an emergency and I've told her many times that she's very beautiful. So I agreed with her and told her that she was ugly.

"WIBTA if I was to talk to my boss about their weight and suggest a diet? | So I started working for a new company roughly three months ago and I was interviewed by them and we see each other nearly everyday. And they are such a good boss, and I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say they‚Äôre the best I‚Äôve had in my life. 

They sort things out with no issues, the rota is on spot - the rarely are any complains. And if you need to rearrange stuff to fit you better, no problem. The whole business runs like butter across bread on a summer‚Äôs day. 

Though recently, I‚Äôve noticed that they are not making perhaps the wisest decisions when it comes to food. They are in the office most of the their time at work, so when staff pop in and out to get their stuff (or administer medication, tally monies, document stuff of our own etc.), we see them, and occasional other staff. So whenever I‚Äôm in there, I tend to ask if anyone wants a cup of tea or need anything. I‚Äôm not trying to be a so called ‚Äòboss‚Äôs pet‚Äô by any means, I ask everyone not just him and I do it because I think it‚Äôs a nice thing to do. 

He asked me if I can just warm up his food for him and naturally I complied. He handed me two burgers that just needed reheating in the microwave. This asking for favour has been going on for a few weeks, which I don‚Äôt mind; it‚Äôs not an everyday thing at all, just occasional really that he asks me. But over time, their eating habits haven‚Äôt changed. 

They did say they‚Äôre suffering from diabetes and they are on the _plus_ side. I was thinking of cooking them breakfast once to introduce them to a diet I have in mind. I was thinking of Keto or Atkins. I am aware that drastic changes in a diet are difficult, so I would naturally also advise them to consult a GP or a dietitian. But my thinking process is that if they like the breakfast, they may rethink dieting. I do not know if they‚Äôre are dieting at the moment, but it honestly does not look like they do. 

Bare in mind I am fat, I am quite young in comparison to him (just over 20 years) and I am not dietitian by any means. I honestly don‚Äôt want to seem like a dick though by doing it. 

Now, I do realise that I generally am quite impulsive so I thought I‚Äôd turn to you guys for judgement before I act on it.

Problem is, my rm just somehow loves to provoke drama. It started off with her bf staying over rent free and not doing anything. Raising our utilities about 50 bucks higher. So I confronted her on that. Then recently she had the nerve to go on twitter and post about how dare I whine/complain about caring for her dog. All the while SHE ASKED ME TO WALK HIM THROUGH MESSAGE. My friends recently showed me another thing she posted basically saying she wants out. 

So we talked about it. Shes moving out. Well here's where I was confused. It's already november and all of a sudden she wants out by the end of this month. She also just told us this.. then she tells us she hasn't packed yet but plans to soon. She then says she plans to leave her furniture and such until its convenient for her.

"AITA for assuming someone went to rehab for drugs? | So the other night I was at my SO‚Äôs work party and one of the guys brought his new girlfriend. It‚Äôs a really relaxed environment, we all just chilled at the office and ate dinner and drank a little bit. We all start breaking off into smaller groups having different conversations, and I start talking to 2 of the techs, one of whom is the one with the new girlfriend. A few minutes into the conversation the girlfriend walks up and I end up chatting with her and I ask her what she does for work.

She tells me she is a real estate agent but that she‚Äôs been out of work for a little while because she was in rehab. 

I was kind of taken aback that she was so open about something like that with people she just met but hey, some people are just like that. Good for her for getting clean, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd be proud of that too. That‚Äôs pretty much my entire thought process on this. My whole family has dealt with addiction and my mother even passed away a few years ago from an OD, so I‚Äôm no stranger to the demon that is drug addiction, nor am I someone who would pass judgement. 

I say to her ‚Äúoh wow, it‚Äôs amazing that you completed the program. I‚Äôm so happy for you! How long have you been clean now?‚Äù I‚Äôd never usually ask such personal questions but I figured that she brought it up so she wouldn‚Äôt mind me asking.

She got this horrified look on her face and basically shrieked ‚ÄúWHAT? I meant *physical rehabilitation* not DRUG rehab!! What kind of person do you think I am??‚Äù 

I stuttered out a fast apology for the misunderstanding but she wouldn‚Äôt hear it and literally just turned and walked away from me. The rest of the night was super uncomfortable and she kept whispering to her boyfriend angrily and shooting me dirty looks the entire night. 

My SO got an angry text from coworker later that night saying how I offended his gf by assuming she was, and I quote, ‚Äúa filthy drug addict‚Äù and that I owe her an apology. (I got really upset at that text because they acted like drug addicts are only homeless street rats when *plenty* of addicts live high functioning lives.)

My SO tried to explain my thinking, saying how I thought she meant drug rehab and not physical rehab and that it was an innocent mistake, but the coworker says that obviously someone I just met wouldn‚Äôt offhandedly mention they just got out of (drug) rehab and that my assumption was idiotic and offensive.

"AITA for telling my bf I don't entirely trust him? | Ok so I've met some pretty good liars in my life. I've been through horrible situations where people lied to me for months and now I'm generally skeptical of people until proven otherwise.

My bf on the other hand is an innocent until proven guilty type of guy and he prides himself on his honesty and loyalty. He trusts me entirely and never made me feel uncomfortable. 

Well today it came out that I don't feel the same. I am actually uncomfortable with his 'no password sharing' policy and I do think he could either be a great, amazing person or an amazing liar. It just seems too convenient that someone who claims they never lie also has boundaries that mean I can never know whether or not they are lying. 

So while I told him I clearly trust him enough to take that risk, I can't be 100% sure of things. He flipped out, told me I'm insulting him and his integrity,character etc. He said he did nothing to deserve being not trusted. I told him it's not him, just my past, I trust him mostly but I can't help feeling some doubt. He's now very upset, demands an apology and that I trust him entirely. I'm not sure I can do that.

"AITA for buying most of the discounted, expiring food at a store? | Most stores in my country put discounts (-30%) on food that is expiring, or that they won't be selling anymore. This discount is doubled during the last hour the stores are open to -60%, so I often go the store at this time.  
  
I arrived at the store about half an hour before the last hour, so I'd find the best discounts. I also spend some time on my phone searching for recipes based on the ingredients that I find, so that I can buy other needed ingredients at the same time. 
  
Last night I got lucky and found the biggest amount of discounted food so far, so I pretty much filled my shopping cart completely. I have a large freezer though so there is no chance the food will go to waste.  
  
A few minutes before the double discount begins, I see a woman come in, walk around the store and find nothing. She then sees my cart and asks if she could have a few products. I refuse and tell her she should have come in earlier. She gets mad, saying she can't really afford food at the normal price, and that I look like I don't need the discount (I guess this is sort of true, I'm decently well off but I live extremely frugally, which has been a big part of my good financial status.) I tell her that it's not my problem, and start walking towards the checkout. She then goes and complains to a worker that it isn't fair that someone hoards all the food, but the worker says that it's not against their rules/policies. She then cusses at me while leaving.

TL;DR: Bought lots of discounted food, poor woman asks if she can buy some of it instead, I refuse and she swears and yells at me. AITA?",1

"AITA for not telling my parents I switched degrees? | Going to try and keep this short! Recently, I switched from pursuing a Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology to pursuing a M.S. in Environmental Science. There were many reasons behind this, but the biggest was that I was completely burnt out in my previous program. I only joined the program because I couldn't find a job with my B.S. in Psych. Ever since I joined, however, my parents have been bragging to everyone that they have a daughter who's getting a Ph.D.

When I switched, I didn't tell them (I told them 2 days ago, right after my first semester started). There were a lot of reasons behind this. One, I wanted to make sure I started successfully and had gotten everything figured out. Two, I knew they would disapprove. Their favorite insult for me since I was a small kid is ""tree-hugging liberal hippie"" and they adamantly don't believe that environmental science is a legitimate field. I actually wanted to pursue that as my undergraduate degree, but because they took out Parent PLUS loans for me and threatened to cut me off if I switched to that path (\~10k worth over 4 years, if that matters) I didn't.

I let them know 2 days ago, just to keep them in the loop. They went absolutely nuts on me, saying that I should have informed them so that they could change my mind. There was also a lot of talk about how I have absolutely wasted my life (I'm 24 right now), that I'll never get a job, that I've turned into a nutjob, etc. I tried to reason with them that I had my reasons for hiding it, and that I had only just started the program.

Their reasons behind it is that I'm the eldest child and the first to leave the house, making my mother anxious. Also there's the history with my family and making poor life decisions when leaving for college. And I understand that they don't want me going down the same path, but I have literally never rebelled. For example, my parents had to physically force me to not go to school for senior skip day. That's how much of a ""goody two shoes"" I was and still am.

They're afraid of me making poor life decisions like getting drunk or having an unintentional pregnancy but I've never expressed any interest in any of these activities.

So to the problem at hand: I'm trying to be more social but I can't exactly do that when my parents are breathing down my neck all the time. They will literally question me about my whereabouts when I'm not in my dorm or in class, even if it's just to go to the mall or get food off of campus. It wouldn't be that bad if they didn't question and call me about where I am so much (which is almost everyday). It's not like I want to do anything bad or illegal, I'd just like a little bit of freedom.

I've expressed this to my parents but they're adamant on tracking me. When I try to explain that I'm 19, my mother says that she's a grown adult and \*she\* still has the app on her phone.

So WIBTA if I just turned the app off even though they told me explicitly not to?

Edit: My parents pay for my phone plans and they've threatened to cut me off if I don't keep the app on (which I can't pay for myself because they also want me to focus on school instead of having a job).

Edit 2: Thank you for all of your comments and advice! I do think that it's not smart to just turn off the app and I'll try talking to my parents about it some more so we can reach some kind of agreement.",0

"AITA for not turning on my Christmas lights for some families that came to see them because everyone on our street agreed to keep them off? | 

So over the past few years the candy cane lane in our town has gotten insanely popular with people from out of town because people have been posting all about it on social media. All of us have really elaborate decorations.

This has caused the street to be so crowded and full of people for weeks leading up to Christmas that the residents cannot leave out of their driveways anymore. 

So I talked over the issue with our neighbors and all of us have agreed to keep all our Christmas lights off except on Saturday nights, Christmas and Christmas Eve.

On Friday night when my wife and I got home there were groups of people walking towards our street and few families milling about the street.

One of the dads came up to me and asked if this was candy cane lane and why all the lights were off. I told him it was and why the lights were off.

He asked pretty politely if we could turn on our lights because they wouldn‚Äôt be able to come next day or next weekend as this was the day that worked for everyone. He also said they had come from downtown of major city nearby (which is a pretty big drive) because their kids don‚Äôt get to see lights otherwise. Downtown area can be really shady at night and the city pretty much just puts on a few string of lights here and there.

I knew my other neighbors would be mad at me if I caved.  I was a big advocate for keeping the lights off except on certain nights at our block meeting. I also really doubt no one would notice because the street was practically all dark except for the lights in people‚Äôs windows. Plus with more people coming I knew it would be more trouble if I tried to turn them off. So I said  ‚Äúno, I‚Äôm sorry. I can‚Äôt‚Äù 

Now it‚Äôs Sunday and my wife found a post online about our street with people in the comments saying how upset they were that the lights aren‚Äôt up every night and that it‚Äôs really unfortunate for all the people who can‚Äôt come on those nights. That it was really good for the community and our neighboring communities. Some even brought up how they asked some of the residents to turn on their lights for a few minutes and the replies to those comments were less than kind towards the residents.

Update: After those posts got a lot of attention. one of my neighbors brought up maybe advertising that it‚Äôs just going to be on random nights (only known to the residents) from now on. That way at least the people will know it‚Äôs not a guaranteed thing and not come in droves and we get to enjoy our lights more often. Hopefully we can get everyone to agree to that for next year.",0

"AITA for vaping at work? | Thraway, lots of coworkers and I use reddit

I (19M) work part-time for the summer at a car dealership, I get my own office space and manage expenses, budgetize small events, etc. It really is a nice place to work.

our office gives smokers 15 min intervals to have a break and light up som cigs in our parking lot, everyday they get basically free time to just chill and talk.

Personally I have gotten out of smoking cigs from a rough childhood, however once in a while I'll whip out my vape from time-to-time.

I decided that during smoke breaks I would go outside and vape w/ some of my co-workers so I can get 15 minute breaks too. Nobody really has a problem w/ it, except for this group of women who smoke together in a sort of clique, they always give me dirty looks and I can hear them call me pathetic just loud enough so I can hear.

There is this one lady who I can literally only describe as a karen, she came up to me yesterday telling me what a pathetic asshole I am trying to abuse the smoke-break rule. She ran to HR telling them I was abusing the rule of the ""smoke-break"". I went in to HR's office and she basically sighed and told me she knew it was ridiculous but for the sake of keeping the peace she told me to just please stop going outside

seriously?? Wow, I want a break too from work, if it was up to me I would just stand outside w/ the smokers. AITA for trying to take a smoke break by vaping?

EDIT- Alot of people are saying I should just go out and take a break anyway w/o smoking, but legally smokers are given the right to smoke 15 minutes a day twice during work. It's either you smoke or you don't, that's the rule :/",0
"WIBTA if I refuse to give my nephew a birthday gift? | So recently my older sister asked me to purchase a Nintendo Switch for my nephew's third birthday. And I haven't replied yet because I don't think I'm obligated to give expensive gifts. My reasoning is that's he's barely turning 3, I don't regularly see or talk to this sister or nephew because they live in Canada and I live in the US, I have never even bought the kid a gift before, nor does he even really know who I am. I told my other sibling that I do talk to regularly and she says I'm an asshole because it's a once in a while thing and I'm supposedly his godfather (I had no idea). However, I don't like the idea of an estranged sibling coming out of the woodworks asking for expensive gifts.

"AITA for not giving a baseball to a little kid? | First off, sorry if the formatting here is a little wonky since I'm on mobile.

So on July 25th I was at the Kansas City Royals game vs the Cleveland Indians, I was there to watch the game, but chose seats in foul territory strategically to catch a 3rd out ball from the Indians. I'm 18, and collect sports memoribilia, and don't have a game used ball in my collection. I have ones that I've bought, but not any that I've caught. After the 12th inning, Indians center fielder, Oscar Mercado threw me a bullet right to my glove after I called out his name, and he saw I was in Indians gear.

This older guy a few rows in front of me tried convincing me the ball was meant for his granddaughter who wasn't watching the game, but playing on a tablet with headphones on. He called me an asshole afterwards. So am I the asshole?

"WIBTA for refusing to split a bill 50/50 between my sister & her husband? | When the three of us go out to dinner once or twice a month, we end up splitting the bill evenly between our 2 credit cards: mine, and the one to her & her husband's joint account. So I end up paying for half of my brother in law's meal, essentially. I let it slide a couple of times, now I realize I've gone & set a precedence: they now expect me to pick up half the tab when we're out together.

Historically, money has always been a very touchy subject in our family. But frankly I'm not comfortable spending my own fun-money on my brother in law's food, charming man though he is. I'm going to bring it up with my sister this week. But first I wanted to make sure there wasn't some kind of tacit code of conduct when it came to married couples.

"AITA for telling my boyfriend's(34) mom to stop doing our laundry? | BF was just in a traumatic accident and his mobility is now fairly restricted. He shouldn't be lifting or bending over a whole lot while he recovers. I work weekdays, his parents are retired. The initial plan was to take him to his parents' house to recover since they are always home and would be attentive to his needs.

We spent a week in the hospital. I worked and slept there each night. We live together, and decided once he was released that we'd both MUCH rather go to our apartment than his parents' house to have peace and our own bed.

The day he was released, I had work. We hadn't been to the house in a week, and there was laundry and dishes to be done. His parents drove him to our apartment, and while I was at work his mother went nuts cleaning, shopping, and doing laundry. The agreement was that once I was home I would take over, and they would leave.

I got home at 11pm, and his mom had laundry out on our bed that she was folding. I thanked her for everything, and told her I would take over, and started moving the laundry off of the bed. We're all tired, I can finish the laundry later, it's 11pm. She wouldn't stop.

Turns out there's one load left and she doesn't want to leave til it's finished. She's telling me to go to bed while she finishes, that she doesn't want me to do it. How am I supposed to go to sleep when there are people in my house doing my housework? I'm not just going to sit here while my boyfriend's mother is FOLDING MY UNDERWEAR. I attempt to help out, but she won't let me. I go to the dryer and start pulling clothes out. She runs up and says, ""STOP doing this, I'M doing this!"" and grabs me by the shoulders physically pulling me away from the dryer.

I'm PISSED. It's 11pm, it's one load left, I can handle it, I'd like to have an empty house and go to sleep. Especially after staying in a hospital for a week. We're exhausted. Get out of my house.

So I just go to my bedroom and try to chill the fuck out. Boyfriend is frustrated about the situation but says, ""She's got OCD, she just needs to finish what she started, she's trying to help."" I understand that she's trying to help, that's why I thanked her and said I'd take over. I appreciate it. But just because you ""have OCD"" doesn't mean you get to take liberties in MY house with MY laundry, especially after I've asked you to stop! A day later, she comes back when I'm at work to pick up where she left off.

I get that she's trying to help but she's not even giving me a chance to take care of these things. I don't mind if she does HIS laundry, but stop washing and drying and putting away my clothing and intimates and going through my bedroom and dresser. We have both expressed to her that I would like her to stop, but it seems she is incapable of respecting our wishes and our space. I can't keep her out of the house while I'm at work. AITA?

"AITA for calling my friend out about why he isn't losing weight? | This happened a year back and I don't know if I was an asshole. 

My friend and I were both overweight, me just a bit and him probably 50+ lbs. We both decided we wanted to look better so we joined a gym and had our mutual personal trainer friend make us a meal plan. 

We went to the gym together, but he never really put in a real effort. He'd lie about how many reps he did if he thought I wasn't paying attention or he'd make excuses about why he couldn't go today. It's his life and I didn't care because I was enjoying the gym anyways. 

I followed the meal plan and lost weight while he steadily gained weight. He kept oscillating between excuses that it's muscle or that he didn't understand because he's following the meal plan and it must be a bad one. The problem is that I watched him eat terrible food all the time and make bad fitness choices (buying mass gainer when he's trying to lose weight). 

After about a year I looked completely different in a good way, while he had actually gained about 30 lbs. He constantly compared us and lamented that I had great genetics and it's not fair. I put up with it because it sucks to feel like you failed at something and I tried to encourage him as much as I could. 

Instead of taking it in and using it as motivation to fix his health, he just started on how weight loss is impossible for him and BMI wasn't accounting for all his muscle. I explained calories in calories out, but he just kept saying he was doing everything right but it wasn't working. Whatever, his life. 

The final straw was when he started discouraging people from losing weight and comparing how he worked just as hard as me. Started spouting that only some people have the genetics to lose weight and get strong. He constantly complained denied that he wasn't properly implementing his diet and I just had enough of it. 

I explained that calories in calories out works for everyone and that he never put in any real effort and that's why he never got the results he wanted. I wasn't mean, but I just had enough of him playing the victim. 

Some of my friends said even if it's true, I was an asshole for not just pretending he was doing everything right.",0

"AITA for not co-signing my ex's car? | I was dating my ex for about a year and near the end she was in a pretty bad car accident and her car was completely totaled. It was her fault so she didn't get any compensation for it. I was taking her to work and picking her up while she dealt with that headache.

A few weeks later she started looking to buy a car. I told her to look at used cars since she couldn't afford a brand new one. She said no, because she doesn't want someone else's trash. Whatever, not my place so I dropped it. She told me her mom would co-sign, but that fell through. Then her Aunt would do it, that fell through. Then her creepy roommate offered, that also fell through. Finally she asked me and I told her I really don't feel comfortable with that, since I knew she was irresponsible with money but I told her I would think about it. I ended up answering pretty fast saying I wouldn't do it. She got pissed at me and said her roommate offered and he was better than me. I told her to go date him then (This was a rude thing to say i know lol)

&#x200B;

Anyways, she ended up buying the car on her own and she got so screwed over on interest she was going to end up paying more on interest than the actual price tag of the car. I told her that was a terrible deal, but she said she could do it and bought it anyways.

&#x200B;

We ended up breaking up a year or so ago, this has nothing to do with the story just helps with time frames. A day ago she sent me a text saying how much she hates me and that i ruined her life. She told me she is drowning in debt now, got her car taken away and has to move back with her mom. She made me feel pretty bad about it but the more I think about it, the less I care and don't take responsibility.

TL:DR: Girlfriend at the time asked me to co-sign a car, I said no. She bought it without a signer and She ended up getting financially screwed because of it.

Either way, AITA?

"AITA for not putting up with my niece's ""fear of dogs"" | I don't live in the same country as my family but visit regularly. This summer I drove 16 hours to stay a month with my father at his house, taking my large adult dog, who is very passive and friendly. My brother and his kids come over all the time and my niece (5) has a ""fear"" of dogs (as well as other things) as in she starts screaming -only when someone is looking at her - most of her behaviour is attention seeking. I've been told this by her parents, this ain't my observation. So, as a result when the kids were at my father's house I would have to stay out the back garden with my dog, even eating meals outside while the family and my in-laws are inside together in the dining room. My dog and I live in a flat in my country so he is t used to being separated and will whine for me if he is locked outside alone. No one corrected her behaviour (I didn't either.) Now my father is asking me to do the same next summer and I can't deal with my niece's behaviour. AITA for telling my family I can't spend the summer eating in the back garden because if this?

"AITA for not inviting my friend to a party that conflicts with his religion? | I was told to post this here so here I go:

So, I‚Äôm throwing a New Years party and I‚Äôm inviting nearly every friend I have. But the party will have alcohol and meat products (including pork) for snacks and my friend is Muslim, so, obviously, that‚Äôs not happening.

I was talking with him over lunch and the conversation took a weird turn. Let him be F and me be M

M: Man I need to learn how to bartend.

F: oh yeah, why?

M: oh I know [mutual friend] likes the 4.50$ cosmos on Thursday from [local bar] and she‚Äôs coming to my New Years party and I wanna make some for her.

F: you‚Äôre having a New Years party?

M: yeah

F: Do you mind if I come?

M: Well. I know you hate the holidays and there‚Äôs going to be pork and alcohol, I can‚Äôt negotiate on either of those because I already bought the pigs in the blanket and [other friend I have a crush on ] loves her 6.45$ ol fashions and I want to make her some.

After this, F was mostly silent for the rest of lunch. I thought maybe he‚Äôd be understanding and appreciative that I was looking out for him by not bringing him to a place that goes against his religion, but my friends are saying I should‚Äôve invited him just to be polite. I said I‚Äôm not going to because I don‚Äôt want to be responsible for something like this again (a few years ago I tried to convert a friend and it ended up a shit show).

Now, I think there are four main angles to this story:

1. My friend is muslim, and there's strict rules to that. I can't be expected to make special accommodations for ONE PERSON when there's upwards of 40+ people planning on coming (I'm just one guy!)

2. It's really important for me that this party goes well. On top of it being, well, New Years, and me wanting to enjoy myself, I Have a friend who I'm planning on asking out here. I can't have to deal with personal drama and people being upset while planning the perfect new years kiss.

3. He pried into my personal life, I was content to just not tell him about the party. Well my mom always says, curiosity kills the cat, pry to far into someones life, you may find things you didn't want to know.

4. I'd be happy to have him come if it wasn't for his restrictions, I'd seriously be ELATED if he came, super happy. I'm not doing this with glee.

Well, What do you guys think:

Tl;Dr: Friend has restrictions which make it impossible for him to come, he's mad that I didn't invite him for it.

edit 1: I said 2 main angles instead of 4

Edit 2: Since there's some confusion about me trying to convert someone in the past, I answered this in another post:
""A few years ago I was having a Fourth of July party and tried to tell my Jewish friend that it didn‚Äôt make any sense why he would celebrate Fourth of July and be Jewish. I offered to convert him that day and take him to my church but he got really mad and left and I haven‚Äôt spoken To him since that all blew over.""

Edit 3: Please read my entire post, including points 2 and 4.

"AITA for not inviting a section of my family to Christmas dinner? | It's our turn to host Christmas dinner this year, but we haven't invited my husband's sister and her family because of disagreements. 

A few months ago, Natalie (sister) invited everyone except my daughter Evie to her daughter Lucy's 10th birthday party. Her reason? Apparently Evie ''bullies'' Lucy. Nat has been saying this for years but I've yet to see any physical evidence of it. 

Evie is 13. She isn't a bad kid at all, but I don't think anyone can name a 13 yo who is nice all the time. She's a very pretty girl, has lots of friends and is top of her class, and has never been in any serious trouble at school, so I strongly doubt she's a bully. In all honesty, everything is called bullying nowadays. Evie is called a bully because she might have made a few mean jokes about Lucy over many years. It's never been any more serious than that and I would deal with it immediately if it was. Maybe Nat should teach
her daughter that she won't get anywhere in the world by crying when things don't go her way. She'll be a teenager soon too, and it's a tough world.

Evie wasn't bothered about not being invited to a 10 year olds party, but I thought it was offensive to exclude every single child *except her*. That in itself is humiliating, especially as I don't doubt Nat will have happily told everyone why Evie wasn't invited. 

In response, I decided not to invite them to Christmas dinner. My husband was absolutely fuming when I told him this, but when I said my reasons - that people who went out of their way to exclude/humiliate our child aren't welcome in our home - he now agrees, but his mother and brother have been calling us non-stop, saying it would be cruel to exclude them from the family Christmas traditions.

So this year is our turn to host the family Christmas party at our home. We invited not only my SOs side but also my side as well. Overall it was around 20ish people in our home today for gift giving and typical American Christmas celebrating. Drinks were shared, food broken, the whole shebang. 

Amongst my SOs side of the family was his pregnant sister. She, I think, was due maybe a week or so ago? But really its just been ticking time bomb for her little one to arrive. Everybodys excited to meet the baby! 

Now our problem is that SIL came to the party with contractions and was obviously in labor (I know this because Im a mom myself - once you know, you know). Every 20 minutes or so she would start having pains and would make noises to pass the contractions. At first it wasnt so bad; I understand how sucky it is and you dont want to go to the hospital too soon because they'll just send you right home. But then it became almost obnoxious. I feel terrible for saying that but it really was. A lot of my family members and some of hers were glancing around like WTF? Go home and do that in private. 

After a while it became apparent that it was making everybody uncomfortable and even my MIL reccommend that she rest at home before it gets too late. She refused and said she was fine. In the middle of the kids opening their presents she went into pain again and this time she even screamed for a second. I then discreetly pulled her husband to the side and told them to leave. I did it politely (""Hey I appreciate you guys for being here but I think its time to go. I dont want you guys to give birth in our kitchen! lol"").

After I said that her husband got angry and quickly got her and the kids packed up. She  visibly upset and before heading out called me a bitch and said that I ruined Christmas for her. A few of their sides family members gave me dirty looks and left soon after.

Im torn on this: I wanted everybody to have a good day but it was very distracting and obnoxious to have her around. I feel bad but still. 

tl;dr -- I asked SIL to leave family Christmas party because she was in labor.",0

"AITA for telling my mom that shes the reason I dont want kids? | Just for context, im a 17 female and live with my mom and my half sister (shes 7) (My dad has been out of the picture since I was born)
My mom was 17 when she got pregnant with me. 

Anyways, to the story: 

I got my period pretty late. I was 15 to be exact. And they were awful from day 1. At one point I literally couldn't move so my mom brought me to the doctor and I was told I have endometriosis (at the wonderful age of 15!) and that it would be extremely hard and nearly impossible for me to have kids biologically. Kind of sucked but I accepted it. But now that im 17 and kind of basically raised my sister, I realize that I dont want kids. Its exhausting and a lot of work and she isnt even my child. (my mom is kind of irresponsible and would leave me to look after my sister and go out with friends and come home late. I have to miss classes to take my sister to school, etc. When my sister and I go out in public together, people think Im a teen mom. I hold nothing against my sister. I love her dearly.) 

So I am deadset on not wanting kids. Like I said I basically raised my 7 year old sister during my teen years and still am. And still will be. 

A bit of family came to visit and when they do, my mom puts up this ""im a great mom"" image which is bs. My cousin(f22), her husband(23), and their newborn come too. We're all gushing over how cute  he is, etc. And my grandma makes a comment about how exciting it'll be when I have a kid too one day which I then say ""Oh, i dont want kids."" And she says ""You say that. Im sure you will eventually."" But i dont, so I say ""No, I wont."" And she says ""Again, your young, that will change."" And I said ""Considering I basically raised Ella (sister), I really don't want kids."" My mom looks like shes gonna kill me and we get into a screaming match and I basically tell her to her face that shes the reason I dont want kids. That because im already raising a kid, that isn't mine, I dont want kids. (My sister isnt in the room, shes in the basement with the younger cousins) Everyone looks confused and shocked and my mom tells me to go my room. Later she told me I was being disrespect and was an asshole. So, am I the asshole for finally blowing up after 7 years of playing mommy to my sister while my mom goes out and makes the family think shes a great mom?",0

"AITA for saying I'm more proud of my son than I am my daughter? | I (48F) have two children. My son (28M) I'll call John for the purposes of this post, and my daughter (27F) who I'll call Hannah. My husband is 50M.

Neither of my children are perfect, they're flawed...we all are. But I'm just a lot more proud of my son than I am my daughter. My son graduated from a top Ivy League college, he's earning a lot of money at a highly prestigious investment bank and he's married an amazingly beautiful and intelligent woman.

My daughter on the other hand, she's always thrown away every opportunity given to her. This may sound snobby, but I don't approve of her career choice. She works full time as a stripper. I was very disappointed in her when she made this choice. She could have went in so many directions, but chose a job like that. I've never once believed she truly ""enjoys"" it the way she claims. It never made sense to me, I always suspected she was trying to rebel against me and her father. She was also admitted into an Ivy League college, yet flunked out due to being overwhelmed by the work and getting caught up with the drugs and alcohol of the party scene. She's only had one boyfriend, and he was an ex con. I didn't approve of him either. He's behind bars now. 

Both John and Hannah visited us for dinner and John told us about his promotion, so naturally most of the conversation was around him and what this means for him. He also told us he may try for a baby soon, which was wonderful. Maybe I did neglect Hannah, but i had no interest in hearing about her work at that strip club.... 

She confronted me after this meal when we were alone and asked me why I keep talking about John and if I'm proud of her, I could tell she was drunk. I told.her that honestly, ""I'm not proud of you. I'm proud of John. You've had so many opportunities, and you just keep throwing them away. You're only hurting yourself with your choices more than you are me or your father"". She just broke down and called me asshole. I didn't like seeing her like that but I think she needed tough love. My husband thinks maybe i was.too harsh. I'm not sure. AITA?",1
"AITA Daughters First Birthday party frustration. | So my daughters first birthday is mid May and her father and I‚Äôve planned a really nice birthday party at his dads house. So everything‚Äôs great and I‚Äôve sent out the invitations and everyone rsvp‚Äôd except the people on my side of the family. 

The day after invites went out my aunt supposedly called and told my mom they might have a vacation planned that week, Today she told me my great aunts/uncles/cousins aren‚Äôt coming because their all worried about not knowing anybody and thinking it‚Äôs too far of a drive, It‚Äôs 15 minutes from my house. Part of me wonders if she went and told them that my boyfriends family is uninviting or dramatized how far the drive was. 

She says that we‚Äôre going to have a party for my daughter at my uncles the day after her real birthday. (before the party I‚Äôm throwing her) and didn‚Äôt tell me about my family not coming to her actual party or her new party until today. I should also mention that separate family parties were discussed for my boyfriends divorced parents but we decided against it and wanted to have one nice party instead of 3. 

AITA for being upset that my mom went and set up a separate party and didn‚Äôt even tell me and then calls me childish (I‚Äôm 25) for not wanting to have a second party?

TL:DR: invited family to daughters first birthday party and I think my mother has caused them to not want to come so she set up a separate party with them without talking to me",0

"AITA if I don't let my sister move in? | So, kinda a long one.

I am 26. I am the youngest in a big family. One of my oldest sisters is 48.

I have a good job (and am currently going through a year of training for a massive promotion - this is a pretty stressful time career wise and financially because it means I'm unable to do overtime or earn any extras for this entire period, overtime being something I usually do a lot of), I own my house, I have an amazing other half and we have a dog who means the world to us. 

My older sister quit her job a few years ago because it was stressing her out - she had no back up plan. A little while after that she decided to move 200 miles away from her (retired) husband and do a course at university for a year, she completed the course but never used the qualification for anything. She remained unemployed for a couple of years then met someone else (who is married and lives on another continent), left her husband, moved 500 miles away and eventually got a job which enabled her to sometimes work from home. She stores everything she owns in my 'box room' as there's no where else for it to go.

She maintained this for about 5 months before quitting her job to travel. A week before she quit she said to me 'I'll be with you from 22 December, does that suit you?' - to clarify, in the past I had said the words 'I'll always be here for you' and 'if there's anything I can do to help' to her but I'm not sure that covers all of this. When she mentioned December, I assumed she meant for Christmas and went along with it.

When she arrived she had everything she owned other than what was already in my house with her. I didn't know she wasn't going back to her place or her work. She stayed until the end of January when she went off to travel. When she's here she's sloppy and doesn't give me any money but uses the WiFi all day every day to call her boyfriend and does the laundry in a way that I hate, she never ever walks the dog or even let's her outside (we pay ¬£50 a week to have someone else come walk her), never uses the dishwasher, leaves things lying around and of course is at this point taking up two full rooms in my house. Some days I don't even see her, she's just upstairs on the phone constantly. She's very very sensitive so it's impossible to have a conversation about any of this. One time I asked her not to leave dishes in the sink, rather put them on the side, and it was like telling someone they've only got a week to live. Even though she's away now, I can't have anyone stay over because her stuff is taking up the whole guest room and another whole room in the house. 

Anyways she's away on holiday now and just text me that she broke up with her boyfriend. She had future plans to go travel to see him, but now they're cancelled.
She asked me about coming back here but the thought makes me want to scoop my eyes out - however, she has no where else to go.
If I say no (except to come move her stuff) AITA?",0

"AITAH for resenting my friend because she won't help me even though we both know that I would have helped her if it was the opposite way? | A week ago my friend called me, she told me she is going on a vacation and she wants me to have her car for the weekend she's away. I said sure, I live far from my family because of college and with her car I'll be able to go back home. All I had to do was drop her off at the airport and pick her up on Sunday. Anyway I drove home on Friday had fun with the family and Saturday morning I was back on the road driving to my apartment. About five minutes in an animal jumped to the road and I swerved to my left to avoid killing it and crushed into a parking car taking off both mirrors I left a note with my phone number and drove straight to an auto repair shop to fix my friend's car it cost me 500 bucks which is a lot but manageable and I thought fixing the other car would cost the same. I didn't tell my friend about the accident because 1. I didn't want her to feel responsible to help me pay 2. I didn't want to disappoint her.
So Sunday comes I pick her up everything goes according to plan but than the other car's owner calls he tells me he got a price offer of 3,000 dollars which I have no way of paying he says (and show me pictures) I hit more than just the mirror. He knows it's a lot so he'll give me a few days to come up with a better offer but he can't wait too long because his mirror is basically shattered.
I felt like my life have been ruined I have no way off paying that amount of money I'll have to drop out of college and I'll probably be homles so as a last resort I call my friend and tell her everything. I say the amount is beyond anything I can do and I practically beg her to activate her insurance telling her I'll obviously pay the damage and the extra the insurance is going to cost her now. She took a few days until answering that she is very sorry but she can't help me because of some impact it might have on her in the future. I was pissed. she would not help me because it might affect her even though I bailed her more than once. Eventually a different friend called me yesterday he said he heard what happened and he can get me a much better offer (almost quarter of the original price) and it all turned out fine. So AITAH for holding a grudge against her?


Edit: thank you all for answering! I couldn't see straight because I had a hell of a week thinking my life is basically over but I can see I'm in the wrong here. I'll apologize to my friend and hopefully this won't wrack our friendship. Again thank you!",1

"AITA for embarrassing my friend because she continued to pester me about not buying her a drink? | Yesterday afternoon, I bought two of my friends coffees because I owed them something of an equal value. I wasn‚Äôt with my other friend (C) at the time, but she saw me give them their coffees later (as did probably 15 other people who I‚Äôm friends/acquaintances with, none of which who had a problem with this). 
C made a comment about not me buying her one and I brushed it off as a joke. But, she continued to make comments about how it was unfair, how I owed her too, etc. I got tired of it and said ‚ÄúIf anything, you owe me for the gas I‚Äôve used to drive you home three times this week (she hasn‚Äôt driven me home) and for the money I gave you to buy me a ticket to a show you never ended up buying.‚Äù I was mostly joking, but it still came from a place of truth. I said this in front of all people we knew, ranging from one of our best friends to people who we would probably consider acquaintances. She got really mad at me and said she was just joking.

Edit: I‚Äôm a girl. We‚Äôre both straight girls. It‚Äôs literally a joke in our friend group that we are the only straight girls. She is not interested in me. A lot of people are commenting that maybe she wants me to take her out for coffee. I promise she doesn‚Äôt.",0

I like him. We‚Äôve been seeing each other about once a week and have been on a couple of dates around town. However, recently he suggested that we go to his friend‚Äôs lake house about an hour away from our town. He said that he goes every summer and is excited at the idea of bringing me along this time around. When I asked who else besides his friend would be there, he said several other friends, all of which are also guys. I wasn‚Äôt exactly wanting to go in the first place because I feel as if I‚Äôm not ready to take a weekend long trip with him just yet as we‚Äôve only been on about 4 dates, so when he said that there would be about 5-6 guys there with me being the only girl, I said that I wasn‚Äôt interested.

"AITA for wanting to stop my autistic cousin from seeing my dog? | Hello all. This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.

I moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.

Last week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.

Yesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.

When his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.

Am I being an asshole???

EDIT: Thank you all for your responses. Just thought I'd add that I have my dog booked in for a check up at the vets tomorrow just in case there was any harm done when he was dropped. He seems fine but better safe than sorry. I have also made a sure decision that I won't be allowing my cousin anywhere near my dog from now on. If that means he and my aunt want to fall out with me over it, I'm more than fine with that.",0

"AITA for cancelling my New Years Eve dinner with my boyfriend? | So my boyfriend and I have been together for four years. We obviously planned to do New Years together. We‚Äôre kind of at the age we don‚Äôt really party as hard anymore, so we just planned on having a nice dinner and maybe walking past the area they do the fireworks when we are done. There wasn‚Äôt a particular restaurant either of us were dying to go to, so I left it to him to make reservations somewhere. He asked me to dress for fine dining. 

Now, through out the holidays my sister has been very sick in the hospital. She has been battling cancer and it‚Äôs metastasized into her brain. It entered into her brain fluid and essentially became something ‚Äúincurable but treatable.‚Äù It has been absolutely **devastating** for our entire family. I‚Äôve been not going to work as frequently and barely have it in me to be social with anyone. 

I spent Christmas Eve, Christmas, and basically almost every day in between in the hospital with her. I‚Äôve started to feel bad and apologetic because I know my boyfriend wants to spend this time with me, but to me I need to prioritize my sister. 

Yesterday I found out my sister supposedly has ‚Äúa few days to less than a few weeks to live.‚Äù I‚Äôve never been more heartbroken in my entire life. I want to spend all my time with her, but I also don‚Äôt want to make my boyfriend feel unimportant or leave him in a situation where he has to be alone on holidays. You may ask why he can‚Äôt come to the hospital with me, but my sister specifically requested not to see any non-family members. 

The hospital has asked that my sister always has someone with her, so we arrange our schedules something like this: my parents stay with her for a long majority of the morning, some relatives/my other sister and I will come in through out the afternoon or when we are off work, and her husband comes at night to stay the night with her. 

Today, on New Year‚Äôs Eve, my family would like me to go around 5-6. My boyfriend made a reservation for us at 8:30. I wanted to try to do both, but the hospital is an almost an hour away from where we are supposed to be going. I don‚Äôt see how I can make it for the dinner. 

I feel like I am abandoning my boyfriend on New Year‚Äôs Eve. Has has no other plans and it‚Äôs too late for him to do something else with someone else. 

He has never made me feel bad about it. He understands that this is my family and it‚Äôs important. But just because he says that, doesn‚Äôt mean he isn‚Äôt disappointed, and I know *I* feel bad. Certainly I can leave the hospital later and him and I can just do nothing and stay in at home... but then I‚Äôm worried if I‚Äôll even be able to get a cab home from the hospital. I‚Äôm worried I ruined his mood and his plan.

"AITA for saying my Dad can't mess up my house just because I messed up his? | As a teenager I was a bit messy. Imo it wasn't ever excessive and I contained the mess to my room. I didn't care about hanging up clothes so I would leave them on a chair. I wouldn't put my makeup away after I'd used it so it would stay out on my desk. Occasionally, I let a plate or glass sit around for a day before I took it downstairs. I never got into the habit of taking my empty bottles or cans downstairs the moment I was done with them. I collected them at the end of the week and recycled them all at once. While my room was messy it was never dirty. I vacuumed and wiped down surfaces and stuff. I put dirty laundry in the basket.

I was never allowed to leave my things out of my room so I never did. If I ever left so much as a phone charger plugged in and unattended downstairs it caused an argument about mess. If I left a book in the living room it was mess. If I didn't put my shampoo back in the cabinet the second I got out of the shower it was a mess. If I left a dish on the drainer it was a mess. So I just kept all of my things in my room and tried to keep up with the rules outside. 

Now I have my own house, I'm quite similar. At 20 I was diagnosed with ADHD so maybe that explains it. I keep my personal items in my room and it is a little messy. I still have clothes on my chair and I still have makeup scattered on my desk and I still have a few cans I haven't taken to recycle yet. 

Outside of my bedroom I've relaxed a little from my Dad's house but I still like to keep the rest of the house minimalist because it's how I cope with my ADHD. My bedroom is a zone I don't worry about keeping orderly but my living room and kitchen are all organised. I don't keep much stuff out there because I find it easier to stay on top of things like that. My bathroom is the least organised but it's all still all clean. I'm honestly really proud of my home even if it is minimalist. 

My Dad always used to say he'd come and make a mess in my house when I had my own. He used to tell me that if I didn't respect his house then he wouldn't respect mine. He came to bring some supplies this week (we're in a country with lax lockdown) and he kicked up a fuss about the state of my bedroom as I'd left the door open. I said it was my room and my space.

I briefly went into the bathroom and when I came out he'd opened all the cupboards in my kitchen and was randomly scattering cutlery, glasses, and plates around the house. He'd also tossed around cushions in the living room and weirdly left an open magazine on the floor. I asked him what he was doing and he said he was recreating what it was like to live with me in his house. I told him to stop and he reminded me that he'd once said he wouldn't respect my house like I hadn't respected his. I told him he had to leave and we argued about it. He told me that I'm a hypocrite and I can't figure out who's in the right.",0
"AITA For refusing to let my friend lump me in with her mental illness? | Hi. I have OCD. It's really bad, and it affects like life in tons of ways. One of those ways is that I have a lot of rituals involving food, but nothing related to how much I can eat, what I specifically can eat, and some other things. It's really just one of many, but it's definitely one of the most prevalent and noticeable sets of rituals that I have. 

One of my friends is in treatment for an eating disorder. We were talking about our various *things* and she brought up that I should come with her to support group/group therapy for people with eating disorders. I thanked her for the sentiment, but said such a group would not be helpful at all to me, because I don't have an eating disorder, I have disordered eating due to a completely separate mental illness. Treatment for specific eating disorders would not be helpful to me, because it would not in any way address the underlying cause of my weird eating. 

She insisted that any time a person can't eat exactly how and what they want, they have an eating disorder, and I said this just wasn't the case. I don't have body dysmorphia, I don't have a poor relationship with food, and if I treated the OCD, the food stuff would go away, just like the touching stuff, the counting stuff, etc. 

She got SUPER offended and wanted to know why I wouldn't consider it at all, why I was refusing to acknowledge that I have an eating disorder, and I just said it's similar to if we both had high blood pressure due to different causes, and she wanted me to take medicine for that treated her cause, but did absolutely nothing for mine. She said it's nothing like that, and didn't even like the comparison to a physical illness. 

She kind of tried to get some of our mutual friends involved, but most of them won't touch it. I still insist that being treated for an eating disorder would just not be helpful to me.

So I go to the intercom and I‚Äôm buzzing our apartment for about a half hour straight, becoming super cold and aggravated in the process. The intercom is connected to her phone which was on silent while she was sleeping. I tried my neighbors too but they weren‚Äôt answering either and no one came to the door during that time. After 30 mins I was too cold to stay outside so I ran like 2 miles to my buddies house. Luckily he was up and I crashed on his couch.
I used his phone to set up an alarm for 5am so I could try again in the morning. I finally got through to her at 5am and she buzzed me in after I took an Uber back.
I was definitely frustrated when I came home. Went to bed for an hour and then I got up and went to work.
She sends me a text and says she‚Äôs sorry I had a bad night and hopes I have a good day so I responded by sayin I know this is all my fault and youre not to blame, but I can‚Äôt help but feel frustrated and upset. I don‚Äôt sleep with my phone on silent so if I were sleeping while she was locked out, it‚Äôs highly likely I would‚Äôve woken up. Also I wake up in the night to grab water or use the restroom and I always check to see if she‚Äôs there; I thought she did the same. So I‚Äôm hurt that she had no clue I wasn‚Äôt around when I was doing about everything I could to get in touch with her. I really needed her in the moment and she wasn‚Äôt there for me. I just feel like if roles were reversed I would‚Äôve been able to help her out. 
She tells me I‚Äôm being an asshole by guilt tripping her, and that‚Äôs not at all what I‚Äôm trying to do. I‚Äôm just upset with the situation. 

So AITA?

Update:

We talked about the situation. I apologized I didn‚Äôt intend to guilt trip her. Happily moved on and had a nice a dinner together. Also changed phone settings in case of emergencies.

A lot of great feedback from the majority of the comments to self reflect on so thank you.",1
"AITA for asking for new brushes | Background: I paint miniatures 40k aos etc... as a hobby and my girlfriend has recently showed interest in painting with me so I let her borrow some of my good brushes and explained how to clean them after use.

Today: Ive sat down to paint today to find that the brushes I let her borrow are ruined, caked in dried paint and both water and brush cleaner cannot remove it. We had a bit of an arguement and ive asked her to replace the brushes and sent her links to where I got them so she could replace the broken ones. She said that she would just get me brushes from somewhere else as she didnt want to pay the ¬£14 for the brushes she ruined and is now showing me cheap brushes on amazon. 

AITA for insisting she replaces them with the same brushes ? Instead of cheaper ones ? 

Edit: The reason she was refusing to replace the broken brushes was that she got me a complete set of citadel brushes for valentines and didnt want to double up. She showed me the order forms from january. :) complex to say the least but a happy ending :)",0
"WIBTA if I throw away the dollhouse my sister made for my daughter? | One of my sisters made my daughter a dollhouse for her second birthday. It was a really sweet idea and gesture but there are a couple of issues my husband and I have with it:

This dollhouse is ridiculously massive and takes up a lot space (like double the size of a normal store bought dollhouse). It is made of a bunch of materials like cardboard and recyclables that she painted and put together. It has alot of sharp edges literally all over, and there is glue EVERYWHERE, and it smells awful. We haven't put it in her room yet because we feel it's so unsafe.

There are a couple of issues we have with it: A) we feel like she is going to hurt herself on it and b) we don't want her inhaling all that glue, and c) the size (it currently takes up way too much space in our house). And to be honest, we would much rather buy her a safer, smaller plastic dollhouse with less sharp edges and super glue smell to it.

I feel awful because I know how hard and long she worked on it, and it was honestly so nice of her. It would crush her if she found out we threw it out. I am not sure what to do at this point.

So WIBTA if I throw it out? And if I throw it out, do I tell her?",0

"AITA for kinda blackmailing my teacher? | My teacher is pretty creepy and always stares at me and I think he probably wants to fuck me. He gave me a pretty low grade on my coursework and tbh I guess I deserved it because I spent barely any time on it. I asked to speak to him after class and tried asking him if he could raise my grade because I think I deserved more. He said he really couldn‚Äôt give me a higher grade but he‚Äôd be willing to let me have a bit more time and he could help me with it. I told him I don‚Äôt have any time this week and he said he couldn‚Äôt really do much about it then. I told him I wonder how the head of year would feel about him always staring at me and then asking me to stay after school with him....

He said he doesn‚Äôt stare at me and he was trying to help. I said yes you do stare at me and it makes me uncomfortable. He said he doesn‚Äôt but he‚Äôd raise my grade if I didn‚Äôt say anything. 

When I left I actually felt really bad. AITA or does it serve him right because he‚Äôs a creep? ",1

"WIBTA if I wake up my mom's boyfriend on purpose? | I (17F) live with my mom, her boyfriend doesn't live here, but he's here from Friday afternoon till Monday morning. 

I work Fridays and Saturdays in a movie theatre, so I work quite late (around midnight, sometimes later) My mom and her boyfriend go to bed quite early, so I do my best to stay quiet (taking my shoes off downstairs, keeping the lights off, etc.) 

Problem is, he wakes up around 7 am, puts on his boots, stomps down the stairs, yells upstairs to my mom if she wants an omelette too, just making a lot of noise. 

I've explained politely that I work quite late, have some stuff to do when I get home, and that it takes me a while to be able to sleep, usually not before 1 or 2 am, so if he could please keep it down in the morning. 5 hours of sleep isn't enough. 

He just shrugged it off, when I asked again he told me '7 is an appropriate time to wake up'. I've talked to my mom too, and I can hear her shusing him sometimes in the morning, but he keeps doing it. 

It may not sound like a big deal, but I've had trouble sleeping for years, and once I wake up I can't fall asleep again. 

WIBTA  if I make as much noise as him when I come home? Just to try and talk to him again?",0
"AITA for putting parsley on my roommates scrambled eggs? | So. Bit of context here. Me and my roommate (25 y/o males) work and live together and we're both pretty lazy. For the new year I decided to start waking up earlier and walking to work and I've started cooking breakfast to make sure the day gets started in the right way. This week I've been making scrambled eggs (american style), toast and avocado with -> FRESH PARSLEY <- sprinkled on top of the eggs.

Every morning this week I've woken up my roommate with a really really pleasant surprise of home cooked food. He always acts really grateful, and I'm happy to do it because I enjoy making food... However. After cleaning the plates today I noticed that he had hid ALL of the parsley I had sprinkled on his eggs under his cup.

Parsley goes with eggs. He's making his morning experience WORSE by eating around it... and then trying to hide the evidence- WEIRD MUCH??

So tomorrow I am going to put more parsley on the eggs I make. I'm actually going to put more on than I put yesterday. So yeah. Sorry if this is the wrong format but can you just honestly tell me if I am the asshole in this situation?? I will update this post as developments happen.",1
"WIBTA if I move away from my kids due to my mental health? | My ex wife and I have been divorced 4 years now. We have two children (9 and 7). My business is really struggling and my ex wife constantly blames me for ruining everyone‚Äôs lives.

I‚Äôm depressed and taking antidepressants which have helped somewhat but I sill struggle to keep my head above water and often it feels like everything is too much and I can barely do the basics to get by. This is especially bad when my ex wife looses it over something small like forgetting to sign my sons homework and calls me a terrible, irresponsible parent who doesn‚Äôt deserve to have kids. When this happens I think about ending it all but I just couldn‚Äôt put my kids though the pain of loosing their dad.

I wish I were doing better for my kids‚Äô sake and could be that loving supportive dad they deserve. I try my best when I have them (2 x a week at the moment) but I know it‚Äôs not the same as if I were fully mentally well.

I‚Äôve tried to discuss all of this with my ex wife but she is so full with anger towards me that she is unrelenting and tells me I need to be stronger and just deal with things. Admittedly by the time the marriage had ended things between us were quite bad, she refuses to attend counselling. 

Ive been offered work about 5 hours away from where I live and I find myself dreaming of starting fresh, being away from the constant torment from my ex wife, and getting back to being the dad my kids deserve. 

If would mean I only see my kids during the school holidays and it‚Äôs likely my ex wife will prevent contact during the term to ‚Äúprotect the children‚Äù (aka punish me) for moving away.

"AITA if I'm upset with my mother for trying to keep me unemployed? | Alright so, I'm 17 [F] and homeschooled. I have pretty strict and protective parents which I've always dealt with. Since I was 15 and a half or so, I've been kindly asking my mother to help me get prepared to eventually begin applying to work so that I can save and be better off when I decide it's time to leave home. It's been over 2 years of asking every few months.

My mother is in her late 40s and both her and her husband (my stepdad) are unemployed and living on his disability benefits. I occasionally can make and save money from my own personal work as an artist, but its below min wage and I can't overwork myself on it. I don't have a state ID and need to order a birth certificate replacement in order to get one which takes roughly a month to order and receive (I've been asking since 16). I'm fully aware of what I need in order to get employed but theres only so much I can get without her being involved. But every time I mention needing to get/prioritize these things, she gets angry and tells me to stop trying to ""start a fight"" and blames me for getting upset about that. And if that doesn't work she comes up with another excuse as to why me getting the paperwork I need and a job isn't a ""priority"". She uses excuses like we need to use the little money we have in order to buy new clothes instead of using it on transportation or ordering my stuff. And she also frequently will tell me how terrible I am at doing my schoolwork which means I can't keep a job. I am behind in some of the harder subjects for me (math, essays.) But I've never failed a school review, and I have overall As and Bs all the time.

I feel like shes trying to keep me home for as long as possible, she knows I want to leave as fast as I can because I hate the environment. I've spoken to family-friends and some people have speculated that shes trying to get money/insurance benefits off of me or is trying to make sure I can't move away so I'll have to pay part of their mortgage and they won't have to. I'm really at a loss of how to feel and what to do. She makes it seem and feel like I'm the bad guy and calls me impatient for all of this, but I cannot imagine I'm the person in the wrong here, I've been as patient as I can but I have less than 8 months until I have no insurance, no drivers liscense, and no hope to leave until I'm 20 or older. So who's the asshole here?",0
"AITA for being upset my boyfriend went running in a thunderstorm? | So this is about my boyfriend, been together a few years and live together. relationship is solid and we're on board with getting married sometime soon.

So I've always been a runner, I do a few 5ks a week depending on free time (we both work full time). He usually plays sports to stay healthy, soccer and volleyball at community fields. Recently he decided he wants to run a half marathon and started running with me. Great! I figure why not do one myself, so we started running every day.

The thing is he has no sense of limits. So last night it was thunder storming and he asked me if I wanted to running with him in 30 minutes in the middle of the thunderstorm. I raised an eyebrow at him and said sure, but it was sarcastic!! How could he not know that I was being sarcastic. So 30 minutes later he's in his t shirt and shorts (it's also 40F outside) and running shoes and asks if I'm ready from the other room. I tell him I wasn't being serious about running, and has he looked at the weather outside. He frowns and says it's fine, he'll just go running by himself.

I suddenly get scared because I don't want him to get hurt or sick so I run to the door and block it. This starts an argument (which is relatively rare in the relationship) where he says it's fine and other people do it and that him and his friends play soccer in the rain all the time. But I point out that it's pouring now and thunderstorming and he just doesn't see the difference. Eventually I get frustrated and just let him go running but make him promise to be back within 15 minutes. He agrees.

It takes him over 20 minutes to get back. He said he didn't realize how much the rain would slow him down and he didn't bring his phone so he couldn't check the time. I tell him he's not allowed to run in thunderstorms ever again (rain is still fine). He thinks I'm being unreasonable. AITA for making this rule?",1
"AITA For telling my husband I don't want the vehicle he is buying for me? | My husband works as a mechanic. He also has an auto dealers license and works with a few dealerships to source work for his garage and find cheap cars that he can repair and flip. This is how we've gotten every vehicle I've ever driven while we've been together (5 years, 3 cars) 

A couple weeks ago, he told me I need to clean out my car to get ready for sale. He was going to fix the issues with it and sell it so he could buy me a Nissan Acura a customer of his wanted to get rid of (because it doesnt have an engine in it and needs work) 

I told him that I would rather take the money from the car sale and put it towards the vehicle I want: a truck. Not a big huge truck like he drives, just a small one like a Dodge dakota or similar size. I've been wantind a small truck for years and have told him that so many times i can't count. 

In my opinion, a truck is more practical for me. During the summer i do a lot of camping and kayaking and its difficult to get my car down to the rivers and haul a kayak tied to the roof of my car. Plus every single car he's ever gotten me has had major issues that he never bothers to fix. For example: everytime my husband get into my car, he mentions that he can feel my wheel bearings are shot, the alignment is shot, the brakes are ""spongy"", the power steering is leaking badly and according to him ""the front wheels are probably going to fall off"" I ask when he'll fix it, he says ""when they actually fall off lol"" 

When I tell him these things, and point out that he got to pick out his own vehicle, he calls me ungrateful and often get really mad that I don't really want this car he's buying for me. It's gotten to the point where I wonder if I should just be grateful that I have something to drive and deal with it, rather that be ""picky"" as my husband puts it. So AITA?",0
"AITA for asking my girlfriend to pay the vet bill and replace her own belongings after she almost killed my dog? | In brackets/italics at the end of each paragraph is what my girlfriend thinks I should add. The asshole will be paying the vet bill/replacing her stuff.

My girlfriend (19) and I (23) have been dating for 4 months. She often stays at my place since we live 45 minutes away and she doesn't drive, so when I pick her up for dates it often gets late so we just crash at my place. Sometimes this results in her staying for a few days since I work. [*She says she would rather go on dates in her town and go home at the end of the night, but that I always make reservations at places close to me and then am too tired to drive her home and won't get up early enough before work to take her home, sometimes meaning she's at my place for days in a row unintentionally and gets stuck in my room the whole time since my roommate doesn't like visitors.*]

Today she called my place of work asking to speak to me saying my dog had just eaten a couple of her prescription medications and she had already called the vet and they said it was a lethal amount and the dog had to be brought in. She told me her mom was there and they'd drive her to the vet, but to meet them there. 

The vet ended up giving my dog medicine to vomit, except she wouldn't vomit there and waited until she was in my car (when me, girlfriend, and the dog were driving back to my place-- her mom went home) to unload everywhere. She is okay now. I asked my girlfriend what happened and she said that when her mom arrived (which I had no knowledge of and totally wouldn't have been okay with her having people over without me there) the dog would not stop barking and lunging for the door. My girlfriend has repeatedly said the dog isn't safe which just isn't true, so she locked the dog in our bedroom. Apparently while her mom was visiting, the dog chewed and destroyed all her things-- purse, clothing, bag of toiletries, etc.. [*While she accepts nothing bad has ever happened, she doesn't feel the dog is safe since she will lunge and growl and she doesn't feel strong enough to keep control over the dog. She thought putting her in a room was the safest way to handle things. Her mom was there to bring her medicine and food, since I don't keep food at my place and don't want her eating my roommates things. She also says I'm only mad about her mom visiting because I don't like her.*]

Not only did my girlfriend refuse to clean up the vomit, but she won't pay me back for the vet bill and is asking me to pay half toward replacing her items. I think it's just crazy because if she didn't have her mom over without my permission, none of this would have happened. I ended up cleaning up the vomit, but the vet bill and cost of replacing her stuff (estimated to be $650 total) is up in the air.",1
"AITA for thinking that taking emotional care of my depressed husband is going the extra mile? | My severely depressed husband told me that I never put him first. I told him that being emotionally supportive (and financially, since he can only hold a part time job) demonstrates my love for him. He has depressive episodes pretty much daily, usually lasting hours, during which I hold him, kiss him, make him food, and do my best to be supportive (e.g. telling him that a part time job is better than no job, and that I am proud of him). Depressed as he is, he tells me that I do not make him happy, that he hates his job, life, etc. I should mention that my husband goes to therapy regularly and takes his meds, but nothing seems to work enough to pull him up. 

For me, it is so much work to remain positive and caring and supportive when depression takes over. It takes a lot of energy just to have the same conversations, day after day, about how hopeless everything is, how life is not worth living, etc. It takes a lot of energy to hear ""I am not happy with you,"" and stay strong because you know that's depression talking. Everyday, I see myself putting aside what I would like to be doing with my evening to take care of him. When I confronted with this, his response was that I knew what I was getting into, that emotional support is a core feature of a marriage, and that it does not count as putting him first. 

So, am I the asshole for thinking that taking care of my depressed husband is going the extra mile?
 
Edit: To answer the question that many of you bring up, yes, I do go to therapy, though more than therapy it feels like me weekly venting. The problem is that, as long as my efforts are not recognized by my husband, I remain selfish in his mind.  ",0
"AITA for not forgiving my brother? | Our family had a cat who was born in our house. She was incredibly sweet, but she had some intellectual and physical disabilities. I have been moved out of my parents house for years now, but visit often. My brother let me know via text that our cat had died. He invited a friend over and that friend brought his dog.

"AITA for wanting my stepdaughter to do more chores? | I live with my husband and stepdaughter (a young adult), and most of the household chores fall to me. My stepdaughter does very little chores. Her only regular responsibilities are to clean her own room and bathroom, take out trash, and take turns cooking and washing dishes. To be fair, she's a pretty clean person and picks up after herself, but there's still grocery shopping, dusting, vacuuming, etc, and she rarely does any of that.

Last time I told her she needed to do some chores when she got home, she said ""I'm pretty sure that's your job"" and demanded to know why the work wasn't already done. I tried talking to my husband, but he's not much help. He'll sometimes take over the chores that I asked my stepdaughter to do, while she's off doing whatever she wants. The last time I talked to him he yelled at me not to antagonize her and made sure to help more with the chores.

Since we had that talk, my husband kept his word, and the chore split is much more even between the two of us, but my stepdaughter still hardly does anything. My husband talked to my stepdaughter about hiring a house cleaner, and my stepdaughter was okay with that, but said we would have to pay for the cleaning, and it seemed too expensive, so we decided to forget it.

My question is, with my husband doing a bigger share of the chores, I'm doing much better now, however I still think it's not fair how little my stepdaughter helps. AITA if I continue to insist my stepdaughter do chores too just on principle, even though I don't technically ""need"" her help?",1
"AITA for not letting my roommate wear my shirt? | This happened a while ago but me and my roommate are in quarentine and I still think I'm in the right in this situation so we decided to put it to rest.

A few months ago I got a new job in a different state, my roommate ""Anna"" set me up with the interview and invited me to live with her rent free while I got myself on my feet. Anna was in HR at the new company I was starting at and wanted to make a career change into sales so she was going on interviews for new companies.

&#x200B;

Anyways Anna was great, she honestly really helped me out in a tough time and I ended up living with her rent free for 6 months, in that time we worked together as well, until the end when Anna finally got a new position. I was extremely happy for her and she was so excited as well. Her new boss wanted her to come into the office after work one day to sign the offer letter in person as well as take her out for dinner with her new team.

&#x200B;

Anna was ecstatic and dressed nicely for work that day as she would have to leave right at 5 in order to get into the city on time. Now here's where the issue comes in. Right around 4-4:30 Anna rushes over to my desk and I notice that a blue pen had exploded all over her pink blouse. The colors matter because there was clearly no hiding it, the ink had ruined the shirt, not even a washer was going to be able to get the color out. She asked me if we could change shirts so that she didn't have to go meet her new boss / team members with a ruined shirt as she would look unprofessional. I told her no.

&#x200B;

She asked me why, and I told her I just didn't feel like switching shirts and wearing a stained shirt going home. Anna told me that it was ridiculous because I just had to drive home in the stained shirt and could change there where as she had to go straight into the city from work and had no option to go home to change beforehand. I told her it was my clothes and therefore my decision. I told her to ask another co-worker to which Anna told me she couldn't as she hadn't officially given her two weeks yet (she was going to do this after signing her offer letter) and didn't want to explain to someone why they absolutely needed to switch shirts with her. I told her that wasn't my problem.

&#x200B;

Eventually Anna ended up pulling a co-worker aside and explaining the situation and the co-worker switched shirts with her. Anna looked pretty ridciouls as she was wearing white dress pants and the shirt she got was a white blouse, which I did feel sorta bad for, but I didn't feel bad for saying no. A lot of our mutual friends said I was being ridiculous and should have just switched with her.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Wow this blew up, honestly I still don't really think I did anything that wrong, at the end of the day my property is my property and thats how I feel. Plus Anna had just ruined her own shirt with ink how could I trust that she wouldn't ruin mine? 

&#x200B;

The reason I included everything about what Anna has done for me is because she really is an amazing friend and I respect the hell out of her, I didn't want to make it seem like I didn't appreciate everything she has done for me because I DO, I just didn't want to give her my shirt and her and I were in a disagreement on that so I decided to leave it to reddit. I guess I'll accept my fate of YTA but I still don't think people need to let friends use their things that they own. ",1

"AITA for locking the door to the room while my roommate was in the shower? | My roommate and I share one dorm room. She has a bad habit where, sometimes, she‚Äôll leave to take a shower and not take her key or cell phone with her. Usually it‚Äôs not a problem because I‚Äôm in the room. However, I do have a really ingrained habit of taking my key out and locking the door, so if I‚Äôm not in the room and she‚Äôs not in the room, I will do it without thinking about it. 

A couple of weeks ago she went to go take a shower in the morning, while I was asleep. I got up, got ready to leave, and locked the door on the way out. Fortunately I was just going to grab something for breakfast so she was only stuck outside the room in her towel for a few minutes.

Yesterday, same situation. Woke up, she was gone. I was running really late so I rushed my routine and locked the door on the way out. When I got back after class, she was wearing the clothes of another girl in the dorm and PISSED. She asked why I didn‚Äôt look for her to see if she was in the showers when I saw she was gone and the door wasn‚Äôt bolted. I said I didn‚Äôt really think about it and asked why she didn‚Äôt call me. She doesn‚Äôt know my number by heart and couldn‚Äôt find anyone with it. One of her friends was there and remarked as though he was trying to be a peacekeeper that I REALLY should have checked to see if her towel was gone after the first time she got locked out and, if it was gone, gone to the showers and called around looking for her. I thought this was a little ridiculous and said so in a joking tone, but nobody was laughing. Now I have a bunch of people pissed at me because she‚Äôs more popular than me in the dorm.

I wasn‚Äôt trying to teach her a lesson or anything, I honestly didn‚Äôt even think about it. However, thinking on it now, I don‚Äôt really get why it‚Äôs on me to always keep track of whether she‚Äôs showering to see if I should lock the door, when it would be so easy for her to take her key.

"WIBTA for not giving polyamorous relationships a ""plus two"" for our wedding | (Obligatory throwaway account)

Future husband and wife team here, planning our wedding for late April.  We live in a large progressive city and have run into a modern wedding ethics dilemma.  We have multiple guests attending that are in polyamorous relationships.  Not a problem, or so we thought.  All of these guests happen to be in a relationship with a single primary. So naturally, they are all bringing their primary with them to our wedding as their plus one.

One couple we have known for a long time, such that one will be our MC for the evening.  The other is now asking for additional ""plus one"" as we are taking their partner away for most of the evening so they will be ""alone"".  They haven't been dating this other person very long, but honestly, we do know this person better than most of the out of town family we are inviting.  With a few rejected invites we could definitely accommodate them easily without impacting our budget.

However, we don't want to give them any more invites.  It's just a matter of principal.  While we could accommodate one additional person, we could not accommodate a bunch of additional invites.  The ""plus one"" rule is tidy as it can apply to anyone, poly or not.

So WWBTA (Would We) if we denied them an additional invite? Logically we think we are ok, but this couple is doing a lot for our wedding (beyond just the MC thing) and we kinda feel like dicks for not accommodating them at all.

UPDATE:

Hi All,

Thanks for the replies.  For reasons we will elaborate on shortly, this topic is a hot piece of gossip right now in our friend group, so we appreciate being able to put it out there to a neutral party.

This request was not normal for the couple in question.  Wife has known them for 10 years, Husband for 7 and only once have we met any of the additional members of their relationship and that was for a board game night.  They share what is going on in their relationship, but still keep it separate from the larger friend group by their own choice.  This new person is different.  We see them a lot.  It's all good though.  Everyone seems happy, the new person is cool, so why would we judge?

Normally, we would seek advice from our friend group, but we knew this would be fire.  This big change in their relationship is already creating a lot of talk, and news that they would be coming to our wedding would be out of our control once it is out there.

...so we are disinviting all of them so they don't steal attention on our big day...

JOKING! We kid... we kid...

We talked to the couple, told them we would be giving this person an individual invite as part of our ""B list"".  We also asked their permission to put this info out publicly so if any drama comes from it, it will die down before the wedding.  They were cool with it. We also showed them this thread and had a good laugh.

So we put it out there to another of our polyamorous friends and they were far from offended.  Their reaction was literally, ""oooooooooooohhhh, so they are seriously now then?""  

Thanks everyone! ",0

"AITA for selling my Christmas bonus? | I want to make it clear I‚Äôm not an ungrateful employee, just a struggling one. My boss gave all of his employees a 100 dollar debit gift card that can be used mostly anywhere. The only problem with this is there is nothing I ‚Äúneed‚Äù, Besides money for rent. I traded the gift card for $80 to help cover January. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal but a lot of my coworkers found out (guy I traded with has a big mouth) and are telling me I shouldn‚Äôt be doing that. AITA?

She is getting evicted from her house. Her boyfriend, the father of her child, left her. Her life is basically falling apart. I would‚Äôve helped her out, if she had not insulted me. 
 
She asked me if she could live at my place. I was happy to let her in. She then proceeds to say how life is unfair that she works so hard and gets nothing, while I don‚Äôt work and become rich. That made me a bit mad, but that wasn‚Äôt the worst part. Then, she proceeds to insult my appearance. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still a virgin? Right? Makes sense‚Äù. I really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that bad. I‚Äôm 22, which is only about a standard deviation from average.
 
Then, I got pissed. I just said ‚ÄúYou and your child are not allowed in my house. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù You know, you‚Äôre not supposed to bite the hand that feeds you
 
She then proceeded to insult me even more. I just didn‚Äôt listen to that. Then rumors spread. Now a couple of my friends think I‚Äôm being to harsh

"AITA for supporting my girlfriend‚Äôs weight loss? | My girlfriend is 24. She and I have dated for 2 years. She is 5‚Äô9 bordering 5‚Äô10 and weighs 130 pounds. She is self conscious about her face and body. She told me that she looked the best a few years ago when she weighed 110 pounds. She says that she‚Äôs ‚Äúchubby‚Äù and wants to be slim. Her ‚Äúproblem areas‚Äù are her thighs and belly.

So now, she says she wants to lose 20 pounds by July. I think that‚Äôs a realistic goal, and since I‚Äôm into fitness, I thought I would try and help her achieve it. I even went to the grocery store and picked out low calorie foods with her.

Yesterday we ate dinner at my parents house. Mom asked what we wanted to drink, GF said she wanted Coke, and I corrected her saying, ‚ÄúShe means diet coke.‚Äù I explained to her that my girlfriend was trying to lose 20 pounds by the summer. 

After dinner, my mom pulled me aside and told me that my girlfriend is ‚Äúalready skinny‚Äù for her height and that if she lost weight it would be unhealthy. I told her she doesnt need to be so concerned.

I think she‚Äôs just anxious because my sister is a recovering anorexic. But my girlfriend is dieting in a healthy way. AITA for supporting and helping her?",1

"AITA for asking my sister's MIL to leave my house? | My parents had 5 kids, of which I'm the oldest. After my mom passed away when I was 20, my dad got remarried and had 3 more children.

My dad also passed away a few years ago and left our childhood home to all 8 siblings. However, most of us have moved to live in other states. Only my step mom, youngest step sister Amy, her husband, and daughter live there now. 

Or so I thought, until I came to visit last week and found out that Amy's MIL has been living there for months. I got upset that no one told me. As the oldest, I felt I deserve to know especially since the house is partly mine. In addition, Amy and her husband run a catering business out of the house and have a number of employees. And it bothered me that the MIL was telling some of the workers to do this and that like she owned the place. So I decided to talk to Amy. 

She told me that after she gave birth to my niece last year, the MIL came to stay with them for a few months to help take care of the baby and sometimes help out with the business. She was such a great help and everyone got along so well that Amy asked her to move in with them for good, especially since MIL didn't have any other family and was lonely by herself. Furthermore, our childhood home is so big and so many rooms were empty, Amy thought it might be nice to have more people living there. She also talked to a couple of our other siblings and no one objected so she went ahead with it.

But the thing is no one told me, and I'm not ok with it. It's not Amy's husband's house, and it's not the MIL's house. She has no right to live there and order people around like it's her house. So Amy talked to her husband about it, and the next day the MIL packed up her things and left.

The issue blew up and now the siblings are divided. AITA?

EDIT for additional info & clarification. 
1) By genetic terms, Amy is my half sibling rather than step although I do tend to use the 2 terms interchangeably.
2) My dad remarried when I was 22 and had Amy when I was 27. So her MIL is actually closer in age to me than I am to Amy. Both MIL and I are in our 50s. I wouldn't say that MIL is elderly.

EDIT 2: a lot of people brought up why the house isn't passed on to my step mom. My dad bought another house and has her as the co owner so naturally after he passed that house went to her. She wasn't left out of the will under malicious intent or anything.",1

"AITA for telling my wife she needs to remember that she has a husband | My wife and I have been married for almost a decade. She is very caring and attentive and has always wanted to be a mother. We were unable to have biological children but recently adopted a baby boy. This has changed things.

Ever since the adoption, my wife has been entirely focused on my son. She rarely makes the time to talk to me beyond basic ‚Äúhow was work‚Äù type questions and telling me to change the baby‚Äôs diaper or hold him. She has stopped doing all the little things for me that made me feel loved.

I tried to sit her down and remind her that she has a husband too, and I have managed to balance time with the baby and being there for her. She got upset with me and told me that she‚Äôs still adjusting to motherhood. I told her this is something she could take into account. She said I was rushing her and being condescending. She then decided to accuse me of not stepping up and doing as much as she is. I got angry and I will admit that I yelled that she takes me for granted. She took my son to her mothers house and told me she needs time away from me. 

I know it escalated and blew up, but I feel she‚Äôs being unreasonable and irrational at the moment. Am I the asshole for reminding her that she is a wife and not just a mother?",1

"AITA I ‚Äúlost‚Äù my sister | 
mobile sorry and my sister is 4. 

Today I unfortunately woke up late at 730 and I was willing to take my sister a bit late to school (we ride the bus). I head into the shower and hop out at around 8. I start getting dressed and I‚Äôm just about ready I just needed to find my shoes. I go out and look for my sister so we can both put on my shoes. I start looking around in the living room, my mom‚Äôs room, and even the room I changed in. The only person there was my nana. I didn‚Äôt think much of it and just left thinking my mom took her school. 

I get to school at 915 my class starts at 930. I am in my class early so I can do an important project that was due today. I‚Äôm in class and I get a text from my mom at 918 asking if I had my sister almost at school.

I call her cause this was about to be a big problem and I couldn‚Äôt just text her that I didn‚Äôt have my sister. So I‚Äôm calling her and she picks up asking me what‚Äôs up. I tell her I don‚Äôt have my sister and I never did. I told her that when I got out the shower no one was there but nana. Now she was upset with me. She said that she was my responsibility in the mornings. I told her that how can I know where she‚Äôs at while I‚Äôm in the shower. How can I possibly know the whereabouts of everyone in the house while in the shower. I tell her I thought she took my sister to school and she says no.

She asks where I‚Äôm at and I tell her I‚Äôm at school. She tells me that I needed to head home and find my sister . I tell her I can‚Äôt do that cause I have a project due for that class and I‚Äôll lose points on it. She then says that my sister should be my one priority and that it doesn‚Äôt matter. 

So I get up and leave. I start heading to the bus stop and call my nana cause she was still home,  her and ask if my sister was still home she says no. I start listing off all the places I looked before I left she says she‚Äôs not home. She starts getting worried and I tell her my sister is missing. So now she‚Äôs making a fuss. 


She hangs up telling me my mom is calling to I start dialing my little brother who would be the last person who saw her before the house got empty. He tells me that she was laying down asleep in mom‚Äôs bed and I tell him no one was in mom‚Äôs room. He tells me ok and I tell him I‚Äôm going to go find her. I hang up and get ready to call the police when my mom sent a ‚Äúcall me NOW‚Äù text.

I call my mom again and ask what‚Äôs going on. She tells me that my sister is at school and that she took her this morning. I tell her that she just wasted my time and I was about to call the cops. I tell I missed an important end of semester assignment and that I worried my brother and my nana. 

She said it was my fault because I should‚Äôve known where my sister was at and that I need to learn how to take responsibility better. I was so pissed. I told her she was being ridiculous and obnoxious and that because of her little test I failed a class.

"AITA for throwing pieces of bread after she refused to listen to me? | My daughter, who is 17 has trypophobia, and is literally terrified of any object with a cluster of holes.  Sponges, bread, foam, etc.  She's dealt with this since she was about 3 and I used to think she was lying about it because it just seemed so weird to me.

I asked her to go to the store for me to pick up some ice cream.  She shook her head and said she didn't feel like walking anywhere.  I told her she could suck it up and walk across the street, still didn't listen to me.  I would go myself but I just had knee surgery and walking is damn near impossible.  I  told her that if she didn't listen to me, I would throw a piece of bread or a sponge at her.  She told me I was lying, so I took pieces of bread and chased her through the house with it.  She got some down her shirt and she was screaming as if she was dying or in immense pain.  She told me she hated me and that I was a horrible person, and then complained that using her fear against her was ""manipulative"" and ""unfair."" but I warned her about what I would do if she didn't listen and I only did it after an hour of her not listening to me.  She was all around being dramatic and cried for almost 3 hours straight while in the shower.  I sort of feel like an asshole for doing what I did but I also think she had it coming since she didn't listen to me and she was warned that I would do what I did if she didn't listen.

"AITA for lying about how I got a prominent scar? | Obligatory 'on mobile' warning. 

So some backstory- I (19F) have a very obvious clusters of scars on my throat from an incident when I was younger. I normally do whatever I can to hide it (ie. wearing turtlenecks or lots of necklaces and chokers) but sometimes it's not possible or I forget about it.

Normally, people stare a bit but don't ask questions but occasionally, someone will ask what happened/ if I'm okay. I normally just give a kinda vague 'Oh I had a surgery when I was younger'-type answer and change the conversation and people will generally leave it. I don't really want to or feel I have to disclose to strangers what actually happened as it's none of their business imo.

The incident- I was at my friend's(21F) house and her granddad asked me what the scars were from. I told him my usual surgery answer and he didn't ask anymore questions. My friend didn't say anything at the time either. She does know what the scar is actually from as we've been friends for about six years. I forgot about it until last night, when I got a text where she was basically berating me for lying about it and saying I was being disrespectful to throat cancer survivors and I shouldn't be ashamed of what happened and it was dishonest and by lying about what the scars are from, I'm adding to the stigma that people with mental health problems are liars/ attention seekers and so on. I have /never/ said my scars were in anyway related to throat cancer or cancer of ANY kind so I honestly have no clue where that comment came from. 

I think I was probably an AH in my reply but I basically just told her to fuck off and that it's my choice and that it's easy for her to say that I shouldn't be ashamed when she's not in my situation. She's read my message and not replied.

But she has got me worrying about whether it is an AH move to lie about them. My boyfriend agrees with my initial opinion and says it's my choice at the end of the day but a few of my friends are on the fence. So, I'm just kinda wondering if my friend was right and if I am the AH for this?",0
"AITA being petty and taking back the jewelry I got my girlfriend | Been lead to believe what I have done is 100% assholeish by my friends. But I think the context makes it acceptable. So I'm asking here to decide whether I should be the bigger person.

My (now ex-) girlfriend and I have been dating for 4 years. Over this time I've gotten her jewelry for her birthday/christmas/basically any present. I actually dislike giving jewelry as a gift as it's kind of cliche, but it's what she always wanted, so whatever I did it to keep her happy.

Fast-forward to last month I catch my girlfriend having an emotional ""affair"". I put that in quotes as I have no evidence she physically cheated on me so I guess affair isn't the right word, but she's been talking to some guy for at least 3 months flirting and they even exchanged ""love yous"" and ""miss yous"" etc. She denies cheating on me, but idk what the fuck she's doing texting a guy like that behind my back if cheating isn't her intention.

Anyway, I'm not trying to make this into a relationship post, I just think the context is important. So I give her a month to move out of my house. Eventually all her stuff is packed up in boxes (she's now at her parents house) and I'm waiting for her dad/brother to come pick it all up. At this point I decide to take back all the jewelry I got her since:

1. Try to claw back some of my losses

2. I got her it in the context of a monogamous relationship. She violated that and hence I think it's fair game to take it backk

3. If I'm being honest I'm also doing it to be petty

So I go through the boxes until I find her jewelry boxes. **Important: I only take back jewelry I got her. I didn't take back anything I didn't buy her.** I then return the jewelry boxes like nothing happened.

Eventually she realises and starts asking questions. I  deny everything since there's no way she can prove I took anything. It's all currently sitting in a box in my attic.

So with the context AITA?

"AITA for ""ghosting"" my son financially after he ""ghosted"" me? | My son went a few states over for college this year. I get it - he doesn't want to check in with Dad every day and wants to do his own thing. My issue is that I am paying for him to do his ""thing"" and want to know what's going on. I am not pushy. It's like he ghosted me. My ex is not helpful because she will just send him whatever he wants, no questions asked. She's broke though so the only time he responds or contacts me is when he has no one else to ask. I got tired of it so I cut him off financially. Now he's in a bind because he was counting on money coming that ain't coming. I've done more for that brat that his mom and I feel the best way to teach him a lesson is to struggle. Also, I want this to be an example to his younger brothers.

&#x200B;

Edit: The money he was counting on was for a Thanksgiving flight back home. I took that off the (Thanksgiving) table so now he's either can fly home or not eat until December.

Edit: I hear from him no more than once a week and most of it is his asking for money. And I am the one calling. He calls his mom and games with his younger brothers.

"AITA for refusing to pay my roommate after ""losing"" a bet? | For Halloween this year I was planning to go as character from a miyazaki movie. Upon hearing this my roommate insisted no one would get the costume as its far too obscure. This sparked long (and stupid) debate that led to our bet. If five people recognized who I was then I win $50 . To me this seemed like easy money. However, leading up to the party i found out that my girlfriend could no longer go and that the pieces I wanted to order would take too long to arrive so I never put the costume together and we just stayed in that night instead. He is adamant that as I didn't get five people to recognize me that night (as I was sitting at home) that I lost the bet and owe him the money. I believe that we never really found out whose right since I didnt even go to the party so its basically a draw and I refuse to pay him. So, am I the asshole?",0
"AITA for not going to my girlfriends work christmas party because I wanted to play Smash Bros? | Okay so this all happened in December but her and I broke up 2 weeks ago (not because of this) and I have always wanted to know if I was in the wrong or right here. The new smash bros came out on Friday December 7th, which happened to be the day directly after my last final for my fall term. I saw this about 2 months prior to it coming out and was ecstatic. I told my gf(lets just say H) and pretty much everyone else that I am not doing anything for that weekend besides playing and that people are welcome to play with me. H just called me a nerd and laughed it off.

&#x200B;

So about a week and a half before the game came out, she told me about a work Christmas party on the 7th. I reminded her about the game coming out then and the plans I made to play all weekend, which now included some friends I made plans with. Well she didn't like my answer and basically told me that wanting to play a video game was not a valid reason to not intend her work Christmas party, which I honestly understand and normally I would've attended without issue. But this is something that I had been talking to her for the past 2 months with excitement and it was all I was looking forward too after my finals were done. Playing video games is a hobby that I haven't been able to really partake in while I'm trying to finish school, so I wasn't ready to cancel my plans for that party. I ended up following through with my plans and playing all weekend. We fought about me not going for about a week after the party but eventually got past it. 

&#x200B;

I understand that it's important to be there for your SO in situations like this, but I also feel like I communicated what I was doing well before the Christmas party and I feel like my hobby/plans should have been more respected. So, AITA for not going to her work Christmas party and playing smash bros? ",1
"AITA for declining my best friend's wedding invitation? |  

Hi AITA.

tldr; My best friend(28M) and I (25F) have been online friends for roughly 5years. I would say he's one of my bestest guy friends. I have seen him struggle with his relationships, seen him go from job to job and saw him thrive in his current relationship now. Recently he had asked me if I would attend his wedding and I of course said I am going to decline out of respect for his fiance.

Here's some backstory:

He and I met on an online server. We've never actually met in person but we kicked it super well and have continuously stayed friends for 5 years now. When he first met his now fiance, I helped him plan his first date and even now every little detail of how he had custom made her wedding ring to where he had asked for her hand in marriage. I absolutely adore her, at one point we all were in a group chat together, I talked to her privately via text. I thought we were all pretty good friends until about a year ago when my bff told me that his fiance was actually pretty uncomfortable with me. He said every time he brought me up, she would get pretty moody. He would also say that she didn't like that we had so much inside jokes, also how he had a crush on me, just the whole idea of us being friends really made her uncomfortable. I eventually distanced myself so that they can cool off and he made the effort to tell his fiance that there was nothing more than a solid friendship.

We would text nonchalantly but never to the extent of how our friendship normally was. Recently this year we started talking normally again. I miss my best friend but I also told him that I understood boundaries and I never want to make his fiance feel like she is less than or feel like I am competing for his attention, or whatever she may feel. I've always tried to accommodate her feelings to make it known that I was only his friend and even waved my relationship around saying we should go on double dates if I ever decided to meet my bff and her in person to make sure that she knew I had my own relationship and never wanted to step in hers.

So a couple days ago, he had told me that they had a date for their wedding and asked if I would come. I had asked him about how his fiance felt and he stayed silent. I took the silence as she didn't really feel comfortable about me still, so I softly declined out of respect for his fiance because I never want to make her day be less special because of my presence. It sucks because he is my best friend and I would love to be there for him but I know the circumstances wouldn't be favorable.

Personally, I feel like an asshole whether I showed up or not. I know my best friend doesn't want to have to choose between his life partner and his best woman friend. I want to be there for him but I also don't want to make her uncomfortable on one of her biggest days of her life. If I showed up, I am an asshole to her and if I don't, I'm an asshole to my best friend.",0
"AITA for refusing to continue transporting my Aunt after a car accident? | Hello people of reddit, first time poster, recent reader and a very Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to you all!

So I'll try (and most likely fail) to keep this short and sweet. Every year, my family travel out to my Uncle's house a couple of days before Christmas to get together and celebrate in our own way, so we can spend time with our partners, wives, husbands, children etc

Now for most of us its about a 2 hour, 130km (85 miles for those in the U.S) drive. This year I was tasked with being my Aunt to the party. Now unfortunately she is the WORST backseat driver because if you go over walking speed, she freaks out and starts screaming and yelling at you to slow down.

*For the record, shes perfectly able to drive herself*, but doesnt like to drive anywhere she doesnt know

Needless to say, I wasn't looking forward to this as it would turn a 2 hour drive into a 3 hour drive.

So I pick her up, and drive slowly, and save one or two complaints about the weather, its actually a very nice trip, until we get to the motorway/highway.........now in my country, there is a minimum speed limit on the motorway of about 50kph/30mph, this is a **legal requirement** and you can get stopped by the Police for going under it.

So we get on the motorway and she immediately starts **freaking out**. Shaking, asking me to slow down, blessing herself, screaming when a car goes past etc.

So to try and keep her happy, I slow down to about 50kph and talk to her, explain that this is as slow as I can go but that shes safe and that we're going to get there safe and sound.

Unfortunately this does nothing and she keeps ordering me to slow down, slow down, SLOW DOWN!! Even slapping me on my arm. At this point, I warned her to keep her hands to herself and just kept driving.

We continue on for a few more minutes and she keeps telling me to pull over, which you can't do on a motorway outside of an emergency, I ask why and she wont give a reason, so I keep on driving, at which point **she grabs the steering wheel and pulls it** causing me to cut across a lane of traffic and grind against a guard rail, which also tears off my wing mirror.

By some minor miracle I dont crash and get back in control before coming to a stop, but not before having to physically restrain her to keep her hands off the steering wheel.


 At this stage, I dont feel safe with her in the car so I pull off the motorway into a service station and kick her out of the car along with her suitcase, after taking photos of some of the damage to the car itself. And off to the party I go, despite her very vocal objections.

Now most of the family are angry at me for leaving her all on her own at the service station, and she has been trying to get me to cover the taxi and hotel fare she had to pay to stay at a local hotel.

So Reddit, I ask for your Judgment, am I the asshole?",0

"AITA not letting a student study? | So Context. I run a pretty big Dungeons and Dragons group of around 100 people. We play almost everyday in this one coffee shop which has two areas. The main shop, and a place called ""The Glass House"" which is just a few steps away from the entrance of the main shop (It would really look like a separate store).

Since the glasshouse is closed around 5 days a week, and is usually only reserved for events - the management lets us use it since our group orders a lot when we're there (and in all honesty, we're pretty noisy). I make sure that all the players order at least one drink when they play with us.

We usually have two tables that take up the entire glass house. Each table consists of 1 game facilitator (The Dungeons Master) and 5-8 players. Then after each game, a different group takes over. We usually play music with our speakers to add ambiance since we usually have the place to ourselves.

To clarify, the management does not close it entirely just for us. So from time to time, a few people enter in the middle of the chaos of dozens of gamers. We give them their space, but since the management gave us the go signal - we continue gaming as usual (with the music, loud gaming, etc).

Now. This happened a few days ago. One student who was not part of our group entered in the middle of two games, and took an empty table. Nobody minded her at first as we were all engrossed in our respective games. After a while, she approached me and said in a non aggressive, but firm tone ""Excuse me, can you keep it down? I'm trying to study"". I apologized, but explained to her that we were gaming across a long table, so it would be difficult.

During the entire time, she kept glaring at us, and was visibly annoyed. I approached her during one of our breaks and apologized for the noise, and offered to lend her my headset so that she could focus. I know how difficult it can be to study when it's noisy. She rejected the offer, so I smiled and walked back to my table.

After a few minutes. She visibly stormed off, and went to the main shop, and I haven't seen her since.

So on one end, we could have definitely quieted down and could have definitely at least turned off the music. But we specifically went to The Glasshouse, and got permission from the managers so that we could game at full capacity. We didn't enter a quiet coffee shop and caused a ruckus, it was the customer who entered a noisy place and asked us to quiet down.

Should we have been more considerate to the customer's needs? Am I the Asshole?",0

So we had Mexican food last night and I had leftover nachos. I warmed them up early today, ate some, and then left the rest of them out on the table. I was doing dishes and she was throwing some things in the trash. She yells over ""are you done with these nachos?"" so I say ""yeah!"". Big mistake. After I'm done dishes I see that she THREW OUT my nachos, when I thought she just asked if I was done with them for the moment. I was still gonna eat them later! 

Her perspective: 

This is dumb because I'm clearly not the asshole LOL. BF knew I was  throwing things in trash. Also there were only like 3 chips left, and some nasty crusty leftover ground beef. The nachos had also been out for hours so they were going in the trash anyways. But I still had the courtesy to ask if he was done and he said yes. This is the same guy who was found to be TA for harassing a kid on Minecraft so you guys be the judge. I also told him not to post this because it isn't high quality and he demanded that it be done so he's double TA here.

EDIT: it's runescape not minecraft!!",1
"AITA for calling out women who ghost on dating apps? | For a bit of background I am a 30M relatively fit professional who has been dating off and on on apps for the last 10y. I have had two >1-2y relationships in that time but otherwise nothing over 6 months.

I got back on them about 8 months ago most recently and feel myself almost jaded by the amount of flakiness and ghosting there is now. It's like people just don't respect each others time or interests at all - like it's mostly just a confidence booster to have someone like your profile.

There were two occasions recently where I actually told women that ghosted that I thought it was BS and both times got extremely hostile and defensive reactions. I've told my friends about this and they think IATA and ""that this is just dating these days"". For reference, briefly:

1. Went on a date with a girl, met for drinks near her place at her request because work was late - she didn't have time for dinner so I got something for us to split. Kiss after, said she had a great time etc... msged x2 no response for 4 days until I msged saying that ghosting wasn't cool...
2. The same girl has matched with me on 3 different dating apps over the last 4 months and not once responded to my messages (jokes, ""hey, how are you doing today, XXX?"", etc). Most recently about two weeks ago. Today I asked her why she kept liking me if she had no intention of answering - that I was just gonna delete the match we accidentally matched again. She said responded immediately saying 'sorry that she bothered me and that she just didn't pay attention to these apps'.

I just don't get it - I feel like this behaviour is something no one should tolerate, even among strangers. AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: A common theme seems to be variations of 'you're not entitled to her time/energy/response', so I want to add that I that I went to meet her near her place at her request on a work night and bought her dinner because she was hungry even though we were just supposed to be going for drinks. It's ""harassment"" to call someone out on being rude after that? I didn't want another date from either of these people. 

&#x200B;

And for some perspective for the person that says she got 50-75 messages per week when on these dating apps - so do I ... but when someone buys me a drink or goes out to meet me I certainly tell them I'm not interested after if I don't intend on seeing them again...",1
"AITA for asking that my guests don't wear pale blue to my wedding? | I want to clarify that it's because I plan on wearing pale blue as my dress - I fell in love with both the look and price of a pale blue dress, I look better in it that white, and I'm not exactly pure so I'm okay with skipping that wedding tradition. My understanding of the ""no white in a wedding rule"" is because the bride is supposed to stand out, and so I figured it would apply here; when I sent out the email to the guests asking that no one wear pale blue, I did explain why and also said I was totally cool if they wanted to wear white. Sent out an email that said that, didn't think it would be a big deal.

Then, my fiancee told me his family was confused about the rule. He framed it as ""they aren't sure what shade of blue to not wear"", and also kind of made a little fun of me for being a ""Bridezilla""; him and his friends have been making those jokes because I made my husband get ballroom dancing lessons with me for our first dance to ""Strangers in the Night"".... he didn't really want to do dancing lessons but I wanted to make sure we both looked like we knew what we were doing in front of a big crowd (his friends also lightly tease me about being ""high maintenance"", but I'm okay with that because I am, I'm okay with that, and I know my fiancee loves me enough to do all the romantic things I secretly crave).

Anyway. Sorry to go off on a tangent, but that leads into the issue; I send out a second email saying ""I heard some people were confused about what color to avoid so here is an example!"" with, like, a screenshot of a paint swatch similar to my color. I figure I've clarified the issue, but then my fiancee is a little more honest. His parents, and in particular, his sister in law, all don't like that I'm banning them from wearing a certain color. Their stance is that ""no white in weddings"" is an unspoken rule for society, not just something that they would be willing to ignore because I said it was okay, and they don't like the idea that I'm trying to control their wardrobe. Apparently ""they aren't sure what shade of blue to not wear"" was more along the lines of them saying ""what if she's mad if we wear ANY blue"" (which, I wouldn't even be that upset if someone wore pale blue, I'd think it was rude cause I asked not to but like it's not something to worry about). Hence, my second ""clarifying email"" seemed to them like I had heard their sarcastic comments and was returning my own sarcastic comment - an unflattering shade on their youngest son's bride to be.

His older brother has a nice powder blue tie he wanted to wear and now he can't. I feel like, it's a tie versus a fancy dress, you can make the sacrifice, not to mention it's *my wedding*. And, his family feels I am banning a color from their wardrobe, and they don't like it. I don't plan to send out a THIRD email saying wear whatever you want because that's a lot of emails over a silly drama and also, you know, I don't feel like backing down on my rule.

AITA?

edit: I want to stick up for my in laws here and say it was actually the sister in law who had the biggest problem (fiancees brother's wife, and they've been married for like 20 years so she is a big part of the family). Brother too because of his tie. 

I really appreciate the support, but the actual backlash / assholery I've gotten has been from the siblings, the parents were merely the ones joking at first :) I actually texted them directly after hearing from others on this post just to clear things up",0
"AITA for saying I won't give my ex any more money to help raise our child? | EDIT; Based on the replies, and now that I've typed this out, I feel like you guys are right, I am TA.  It's not the kids fault, and tbh I still think its not really my fault, but whatever.  I'm going to tell my wife about this situation, and am going to set up a trust fund for my kid.  Thank you all for your replies.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: I told my wife last night, and she said she needed some time to think about it.  This morning she's announced she wants a divorce.  Thanks for that stellar advice guys.  Also now that I've told my ex that I'll set up a trust fund it turns out she found this fucking thread, and is now planning on taking me to court.  All I wanted to do was leave that part of my life behind me and not bog me down.  Posting here was literally the worst thing I've ever done.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Throwaway, because I don't want this associated with my main.

So this happened a few years ago, but my ex only just contacted me.

A bit of backstory: When I was 22M I was FWB with a girl who we'll call Amy. Amy and I were both adamant about being child-free and we both took precautions against it. But somehow, despite being on birth control and using condoms, Amy ended up impregnated. As soon as she told me I begged her to abort. However, she decided to keep it, which pissed me off because until now she had told me she 100% did NOT want children, but whatever, her body her choice.

After she had made it clear she was keeping the child I told her I would pay child support but that's it. I didn't want the child to know that I was its father; I wouldn't be involved in its life; I didn't want to meet him. She agreed, and after finishing college we went our separate ways; I moved to New York to pursue my career, she stayed in our hometown.

Fast forward 7 years, I'm now making good money, settled down with a women who I love, and we're planning on having our own kids soon. However, 3 years ago I won a LOT of money from the lottery. Picture 8 figures. We bought a house, gave a lot of money to our friends and family, bought a couple cars and still had a sizable amount left (\~6 million). We put it all in savings accounts and try to spend responsibly.

This is the part where I may definitely be the asshole: Amy contacted me a couple weeks ago on Facebook, sending me pictures of our son (Sam), asking how I've been, and telling me about how he's doing in school etc. Then she says she's struggling financially, and she's lost her job. The child support isn't enough; she needs more. I say no, I told you from the beginning that child support is the only thing I would give her. However, she's heard from a few of my hometown buddies that I won the lottery, and is now demanding I give her more money to help with Sam.

I now feel like I may definitely be the asshole, especially with everything going on right now. I could definitely spare the money, it's more on principle that I'm refusing to give her the money. I feel no connection to this child whatsoever, and feel no obligation to give more money. So reddit, AITA for saying I won't give my ex any more money to help raise our child?

"AITA for telling my partner that it's his fault not his ex that he lost relationship with his kids. | 
I female (30) dating male (35). We will call F and M for this post. We have been dating for nearly 2 years

M has 2 kids from a previous relationship that ended 4years ago. M and Ex(35) are on horrible terms and don't agree on much. They did share 50/50 care. When M start dating me, Ex took off with kids.

We uprooted our lives to be closer to kids and regain 50/50 care. Ex then says she want to move again 3/4 hours away with kids and refuses to allow M to see kids and makes up a bunch of false allegation. 

M and Ex go to a family court resolution which is a settle out of court kind of thing. Ex wants to move. M wants 50/50 care. M realised if he dosent settle he will have to go to court for 4 day trail in which everyone including kids will be examined. M has already spent nearly $90k plus in lawyer fees and cant afford it. M doesn't want kids examined and lets Ex move away with kids. He gets them every other weekend (EOW) and most of school holidays. 

I told M not to let kids moved because Ex hates him and will never promote a healthy relationship between himself and children. 
Well 6months later he sees kids EOW, no other contact because kids cant/Don't call him. He can't attend school function or be involved like he wanted.

He complains all the time about loosing kids. Blames it on Ex. Ive listening and comforted him many times. last week I told him it was his own doing because he agreed to let the kids move. I have given him the option that we both move again to be closer, but he says there is no employment there for him. He got upset that I told him it was his fault and gave me silent treatment. AITA? I did apologies but still believe my statement is true.

"WIBTA for being upset at my friend for not inviting me to his game night? | Recently it was my friends birthday and this morning my other friend asked where his address was, then he said he sent it to the rest of the group. So then I was confused and asked why and he said it was because he was having a game night tomorrow.

Then he said he didn't invite me because he didn't think Id be allowed to go, which was kind of a bullshit excuse because another friend had a game night not very long ago and I was there with him. But still, I said to him ""Oh no it's ok, if you didn't want to invite me that's fine, I won't be pushy,"" and he didn't really try to make it better or anything.

For all I know, nothings happened between us and I'm kinda hurt by it because he didn't even want me there enough to at least ask even if i wouldn't have been allowed but on the other hand it is his house and I feel like I shouldn't feel entitled to an invite so do I have the right to be upset?",0

"AITA for keeping gifts from my ex boyfriends | I recently got into a spat with my current boyfriend over this topic.

It started because he wanted to know where I got my Tony chopper plushy from as he wanted to buy one for his sister and I told him that I didn't know because it was a gift from my high school boyfriend. He got kinda bummed out and asked me if I had any other stuff from exes and I was honest. A few books, a Chanel parfum√© and some of my earring (not that expensive stuff). We then got in an argument about keeping things from exes. He belives that once the relationship is over you shouldn't keep anything from them because that means that you moved on. My stance is.... That they are objects that I like and throwing them away /gifting them is unnecessary. I don't connect those things to my exes and I don't think about them when I use them. Maybe this comes from the pov that his relationships ended badly where as mine just didn't. My high school bf and I broke up because we were just stupid kids and the other 2 and I noticed we were not going in the same directions so we had a clean cut and are on good terms. We don't talk or anything but if we ever run arround the same circle we can be cordial. His ex cheated on him and the ex before ghosted him so maybe that is that?

So AITA for keeping things from my ex boyfriends?


Edit : guys Thanks for your input.... But I don't understand why you are interpreting more to this story? This is really just a spat... A little disagreement we have. It's not relationship breaking... We are not mad at each other or anything. He is not a manipulative controlling asshole that I should dump. He is insecure yes... And I am going to talk to him about this.. Yes... But damn... Y'all need to chill out.

"WIBTA of I let my wife's plants die? | Ok, hear me out..my wife has been trying to ""liven up"" our place with plants for the best part of a year now. She will do all this research about which plants are easiest or take care of , how much sunlight it needs and religious take care of these plants after she gets them but somehow they always die. I think we are own our fourth batch of plants by now. Somehow she is still optimistic about this. She refuses to just get plastic plants cause real ones make her ""happy"". It annoys me to see her spend so much time and effort into this only to be disappointed and sad when if doesn't work out. She has agreed that if this fails this time, she will stop the whole plants into the house thing. 

Anyway....my wife left on a week long work trip last week. She have me instructions on how to take care of the plants. I told her I didn't want to but she begged and I relented. Her plants were looking a little sickly but they seem to be doing ok. I seriously want her to stop this whole thing and just let it go.  But I also don't want to disappoint her.

WIBTA if I just don't take care of her plants and let them die? She doesn't have to know I didn't",1
"AITA for wanting to pay 0$ to get a ""name your price"" ticket? | As most of the posts in this subreddit, this happened quite recently to me.

About me: I am a broke-ass college student who can barely afford living but also wants to get more knowledgable in certain areas. Therefore I was very interested in attending a camp by a globally active group (it's a bi-annual thing).

This group is a data security group called ""CCC,"" on my watch, they are the most well-known group of white-hat hackers.

Now to get to the camp: Unfortunately, they sell tickets, which is kind of expected. Nobody gives away education for free, even if they actually want more people to be educated about something. However, the tickets they sell are at extraordinary prices. To addend the camp (you still have to rent a spot to sleep at, buy food and get yourself a tent), one adult pays \~250$.

Alright, not a problem for me, let's look up the price for children or students - 75$. Since I don't even have that money at hand, at first, I was very frustrated. Obviously. However, they offer a solution that allows you to name **any** price you want.

In fact, this ""name your price"" thing might actually work very well for both ends. On my watch, it's quite unlikely that those who love the project and can actually support it will try to cheap out. It also allows you to reach a wider audience since they can just reduce the price.

So I thought. Apparently ""name **any** price you want"" only applies to prices *above* 75$ or 250$ respectively.

Am I the asshole for even trying to pay 0$ for a ticket to an educational camp?

EDIT: Thank you, kind strangers of reddit. You really made me realize not just how wrong it is to pay nothing, but also why. It helped a lot, thank you very much. However, I want to add in this edit that I also tried paying 40$, which is something I could afford when cutting down my food. Again, this is not possible, because you are not allowed to name any price below the already cheap 75$.

I also want to add that those are experts who I would be asking to teach me (see this great [answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cthl1f/aita_for_wanting_to_pay_0_to_get_a_name_your/exkt0uf?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)), which is why even the 75$ are hilariously low. Me not being able to afford it is a different story, which does not entitle me to artificially ask for a price reduction.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: I also wanted to thank the people who engaged in a very educational [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cthl1f/aita_for_wanting_to_pay_0_to_get_a_name_your/exkujgz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) and wanted to give a special shout-out for the insider information provided by u/gehwegdepp in [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cthl1f/aita_for_wanting_to_pay_0_to_get_a_name_your/exljonk?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).

I for myself have learned through your discussion that helping at the camp would be beneficial for both parties.  


For everyone reading this post to learn something themselves, here is a TL;DR:  
1) Don't pay ""nothing"", that's absolutely disrespectful. Pay what you can means does not imply freeloading, it means that you actually give what you can give. This also works for tours or other PWYC services.

2) Education is not free, especially being taught something in person isn't. If it is, say in school, take it. If it's not, don't complain or try getting a lower price. This also applies for study apps which are frequently cracked or resold by script kiddies.

3) If you have any special request, ask. Ask the team behind a camp if you can get a ""free entry"" by volunteering or contact someone and offer something *mutually beneficial*.

4) Because freeloaders exist, we have to volunteer to support projects we love. Be it to clean up after a concert or something more general like helping the elderly .

5) It's not part of the German, maybe even western, culture to bargain. Even if it says PWYC and recommends 10$, it doesn't mean you should go below that. Instead, see 1,2 and 3.",1
"AITA for planning to let my mother raise my baby when I leave home? | I got pregnant at 17. My daughter‚Äôs father is a druggie and he really can‚Äôt be trusted to watch her and I don‚Äôt think he much cares about seeing her anyway. Given his issues, he offers close to nothing by way of financial support. And what money he does have he probably got illegally. So that‚Äôs the situation. 

I was raised to believe abortion is wrong, although I did consider it anyway. In the end, I couldn‚Äôt go through with it. I‚Äôm 18 now and started college in August. I live at home. My mother hasn‚Äôt worked in years (my dad supports the household on one income) and she‚Äôs currently watching my child while I‚Äôm at school. And then when I‚Äôm home I have my homework and stuff plus I have a part time job. 

So between all of that, I would say my mom is raising my daughter. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if she calls her mom too once she starts talking. 

It sucks because when I finally do have a moment at home I have no energy left to give her. I don‚Äôt think we ever really bonded and I‚Äôm not sure it will ever happen. 

I plan to move into my own studio apartment soon and I don‚Äôt plan to take her with me for many reasons. Space and money are factors. But more than that, I don‚Äôt think I would know what to do if I was suddenly left alone with her. There are moments when I feel so old because I had a kid but then when I‚Äôm with her I feel like a child myself. 

I think my mother resents me and wants me to be on my own. But she loves the baby too much to put us both out, and I know she‚Äôd continue to take care of my daughter if I were gone. 

As for my dad, he feels like no one respects him because he had no say in any of this. And he‚Äôs right in a way. But it‚Äôs not like my mom and I sat down and really planned this out. It just sort of happened. 

I guess I just want to know if all of this makes me a bad person or something.

"AITA‚ÄîI made my boyfriend scrambled eggs and he fed them to the dogs. | Hi all! 

Earlier this morning, I decided to make my boyfriend and I scrambled eggs for breakfast. This isn‚Äôt unusual, we normally switch off who makes breakfast. Normally when one of us makes eggs, we make them plain and just let the individual season the eggs however they would like. 

This past weekend, my boyfriend was out of town and I made myself eggs. I put garlic powder and onion powder in the eggs (while they were cooking) and it was delicious! So much better than grinding some salt on top after they‚Äôre already cooked. 

So as I‚Äôm making eggs this morning, I decide to do the same...without telling BF. I thought it would be okay because he normally puts the same seasoning in his tuna, so I figured he just likes the flavor. 

After BF is about half way through eating his eggs, I asked him how he liked them. I think he could tell something was different, because he said ‚Äúwhy, what did you put in them?‚Äù  

I told him, and he stopped eating. He took like two more tiny bites and decided he couldn‚Äôt finish. Even though he had already eaten half of the eggs! BF says he could tell the difference the whole time he was eating, he was just trying to be nice and not say anything. 

He asked if I wanted the rest of his eggs. Of course I didn‚Äôt! He was just being dramatic! He would have enjoyed them had I not told him that I put additional seasoning in. His reasoning is, ‚ÄúI just like the flavor of eggs‚Äù. 

I told him no, I don‚Äôt want them....I told him if he didn‚Äôt want to eat them, he could feed them to the dogs. (I didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd actually do it!). And so, he fed the eggs to the dogs. 

So reddit, I ask...am I the asshole? BF claims I shouldn‚Äôt feed people seasonings if they don‚Äôt know about it. I should have asked first, and just made plain eggs so I could season them myself afterwards.

Edit: thank you for telling me this could potentially be harmful to my dogs. I should have checked on this before mentioning anything. I am keeping a close eye on them, nothing unusual so far.",1

"AITA for not wanting kids because I don't want to be less important to my partner? | I (18F) was talking with my sister (21F) about relationships, and she asked if I wanted to have kids one day. I said no, and gave a couple reasons as to why. Mostly because I don't want to put my body through the turmoil of being pregnant, and I also just don't really want to be a mom. I said I'd consider fostering or maybe adopting, but it's unlikely. I also said I don't want kids because I want to be someone's favourite person, and a child would end up being my partner's favourite. 

My sister said that's a shitty reason to not want kids, and that I'm an asshole for even saying that. She said I'm selfish and manipulative, and should never get married if that's the mindset I have.

Growing up, I was always my parents' least favourite child, my siblings' least favourite sibling, and my friends' least favourite of the group. This is where I think my reasoning behind all of this stems from; feeling inadequate and unwanted by the people around me. My parents also got married, had 3 kids, and then ended up in a loveless marriage.

"AITA for getting a family kicked out of a restaurant‚Äã | I was at a restaurant the other night with some friends from out of town they weren't frequent to the area and we decided to take them to this very nice join exclusive to the city. It's a pretty standard night until a family walks of 5 walks in and is seated about 2 tables away from us. The 3 kids are all younger than 7 there's a 2 year old, a 4 year old, and a 5 year old. The 2 year old is crying about who knows what and the 4 and 5 year old are bickering very loudly. It took them all about 5 mins to really get on my nerves I didn't want to cause a scene by confronting the parents directly so I talked to an employee about getting a different table but we were a party of 6 so unfortunately we couldn't be accommodated the employee however tell us she would talk to the family which we saw her do. Not even another 5 minutes goes by and the 4 and 5 year old are smacking the table loudly complaining about them being hungry and keep in mind they're being quite loud and the parents are doing fuck all about it. I decided to not say anything to anyone because I figured that the staff would handle it, I was wrong. The kids are still arguing very loudly and at this point I decide to go back to staff and let them know what's going on. Apparently they have received other complaints from people and they we're ""attending to the matter"". We were eating at a nicer restaurant so you'd figure this kind of commotion wouldn't be a problem it wasn't even a place people normally bring their children to. about 10 minutes goes by we have our food and the kids start acting up again I saw the 5 year old smack the 4 year old which started a scene and very loud crying. The 2 year old started crying as well and left the booth and somehow got to out table and latched onto my friend's leg. One of the staff members was already on their way as well as one of the parents. The parent is trying to grab their child and one of the staff members asks if everything is ok. At this point I'm furious, ""Does everything look okay to you, we are trying to enjoy a night out right now just like everyone else here but unfortunately none of us can do that with these children causing a commotion."" The parent who's has their child in hand now is trying to ""apologize"" saying that they want to enjoy a night out too and they were sorry about their kids. I get up and let them know that this isn't exactly a place for children to be. At this point I see what I assume is the manager who tells the family that they have to leave. Now the family is upset that they're being kicked out and look at me and say, ""thank you for ruining our night I hope it was worth it."" Once they left everything was smooth sailing. But the mother was on the verge of tears when she had to leave and the father was to busy trying to calm down his kids. I don't know if I was a prick by targeting them like that.

Because they ignore my husband's nut allergy and neither of us like the dishes they prepare, we just started coming after everyone ate the last 2 years just to hangout with family. I don't normally bring a dish anymore because we are not eating at said dinner and aren't even there while they eat. We don't even eat chips while we're there. I just recently found out my father in law's wife (husband refuses to call her stepmom) ranted and raged every year I didn't bring a dish. Luckily, he isn't speaking to them this year so I don't have to worry about it, but I thought it was odd she got so upset over me not bringing a dish. They always have too much food and WAY too many desserts. So much so that one year they had 2 huge batches of mashed potatoes and 2 different massive batches of green bean casserole and like 6 different pumpkin pies to feed like 15 people plus a ton of other desserts. Pretty much all of that got thrown away. So am I the asshole for not bringing a dish to an obligatory family gathering that neither I nor my husband eats at?",0

"AITA for paying for my daughters gym membership and not my sons? | I have 2 children who live with their father and I. My daughter who‚Äôs younger is 20 and currently working a 9-5, Monday to Friday internship for part of her science degree. She works very hard and has been telling me she feels tired and burnt out. 

She was complaining lately with her job she hasn‚Äôt been exercising enough, and she feels out of shape. I think she looks perfectly fine but I understand ‚Äúlooking fine but feeling out of shape‚Äù as I got that feeling when I worked in an office. She decided she wanted to start running in the mornings before work a few times a week. 

She planned to run outside. Her father and I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with a young woman running outside before 7am in our neighbourhood. We don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs safe. I told her she should get a gym membership instead and go there before work. She said she can‚Äôt afford it because she needs to save money for school and already pays for her yoga membership which is $60 a month. She says yoga isn‚Äôt enough exercise on its own. She was determined to go running. 

Her father and I decided we would pay for her gym membership, about $39 a month, if she promised to use it instead of running outside. She thanked us and agreed. 

Our son found out about this today and was livid. He‚Äôs had a me membership at the same gym for 2 years though hardly ever goes but has been paying for himself. 

My son (26) says needs the gym membership because he lifts weights and doesn‚Äôt run. However he hasn‚Äôt been in 10 months. I don‚Äôt see how us paying for his membership makes him any more likely to go. I also don‚Äôt think we should have to pay for it because he demanded it whereas my daughter didn‚Äôt even ask. We offered.

"AITA for eating without my sister on my birthday because her didn't wasn't ready yet? | Throwaway.

30m here; my 30th birthday was yesterday and all I wanted to do was chill with my family and cook a fairly easy dinner. Lasagna with meat sauce and tons of cheese is my favourite meal, so I made that; my (21) sister is lactose intolerant and vegetarian so she was going to make something else on the stovetop. My mom and I told her once the lasagna goes in the oven, it will take about 40 minutes to cook then need to sit for 5-10 minutes before we should cut it, so she said she would just cook something for herself on the stovetop that would cook in less than 45 minutes that she'd start once the lasagna was in the oven. So all good there.

Except the lasagna was done early then expected, at the 25 minute mark. I took it out and let it sit for 5 minutes then we started eating it; at this point my sister said her dinner still needed 10 minutes because the rice was still cooking, and she thought ours wasn't supposed to be done for another 15 minutes. I just shrugged and said 'sorry it was done early.'

By the time my sister's dinner was done, we were already done eating. She said she was just going to go to her room to eat because she didn't want to be stared at while she ate while everyone else was done. Thought this was a bit of an overreaction cuz she could've just sat there while we talked.

Later she told me on HER birthday, she wanted to eat at 6:30 but that she had to wait until 6:45 because I wasn't home yet. I said that wasn't the same thing. She said yes it was, because she waited 15 minutes so the family could all eat together. I told her she has a different diet then us and sometimes she just has to eat something different and/or eat alone.

AITA here? I think she's really reaching about 'missing a meal with the family' on what wasn't even her birthday. The lasagna cooked faster than expected NBD.",1
"AITAH for getting upset at my fiance for making me leave a less than 20% tip? | My fiance got out of work late last night and stopped at her aunts house on her way home. She used her moms credit card and placed an order for food to be delivered to our house where I was home. The total came to $26 and some change. She told me not to tip more than $3. When the food got here I tipped 5 (from her card) and figured I would just reimburse her mom for the extra $2 since I didn't want to not tip the delivery driver decent. She got really upset at me for that which after explaining to me I could of over drafted her moms account I told her Im sorry I didn't think about that. But she wouldn't see where I was coming from when I said I didn't want to tip the poor guy just $3. (I told her this on the phone before the delivery and she got annoyed and said $3 is fine). 

&#x200B;

I was wrong to add the extra money to the tip on her moms card even though I was going to reimburse her. My issue is that 1. We have food at home, If an extra $2 was going to overdraft her moms account (it didn't) shouldn't she have ate the food at home instead of putting her mother in that situation? 2. She was making me look like the bad tipper and I expressed before hand I wasn't comfortable with that but she got mad and told me to do it and $3 was fine for a $26 delivery. The irony is that she is a waitress...",1

"AITA For refusing to repair the relationship between my stepmom and I? | This is kind of long, so I will try to sum this up the best I can.  So, I‚Äôve known my stepmom since I was 8 and we for the the first few years were very close and fought only semi-often (over arguably little things) and since I was young she was able to gaslight me (almost always in a public place or in front of family and people I cared about)  and then she would run off crying leaving me alone with everyone glaring at me. Along with the fights she would make fun of me in front of her work friends about things I did or did not do. A lot of this though could just be considered white lies but, it really embarrassed me at the time. And this is how it was for a while till she got pregnant, once she had (as she proudly told her mom while I was next to her) ‚Äúher own kid finally‚Äù. I got older and wiser to the situation and got really depressed about this and have only recently been getting better, and part of that was avoiding her as much as possible. This has caused more fights and this morning we had one of the biggest ones in recent memory and I just went off one her about how I did not like her and the things she did to me, and has started to do to my half brother (now 2.5). I ended the fight saying I did not want to ever repair the relationship as every single time it comes back to bite me in the butt. I went back into my room and my dad and I have been talking and he thinks I‚Äôm just mad at petty things and I should just make up since I live with them (I am in high school). So now I don‚Äôt know if I am over exaggerating as it really was a bunch of little things. So am I the asshole?

"AITA for being furious at my wife not checking on a potential fire | We live in a small 2bdrm apartment. Our 2 yr old daughters bedroom is at the end with our living room on the other end. 

We put her to sleep and I was in the bathroom (next to her bedroom). I come out 10mins later and immediately smell smoke. The air is thick with it. 
I yell hey do you smell smoke? 
My wife is in the kitchen doing some homework with her headphones in. She gets up right away Bc her phone goes off. 

I yell with more urgency ‚ÄúHELLO DO YOU SEE SMOKE.‚Äù She immediately gets defensive and says ‚ÄúI had my headphones in and I didn‚Äôt hear you. My phone just rang so I went to get it‚Äù

She has this pattern of behavior with her where she has zero accountability for anything but that‚Äôs really not the point here. I only bring it up Bc it has gotten to a point where literally nothing is her fault. We argue and whenever I ask please tell me the last time something was your fault and she usually goes off saying something like I‚Äôm done w this or I lm not repeating myself or etc to deflect. 

Anyway, again I repeat ‚ÄúI‚Äôm saying do you see smoke in her room?!? CAN YOU PLEASE CHECK‚Äù Now to be upfront, I am panicking a bit here and definitely was yelling. It was not civil or nice the way I said it. 

I have issues w my contacts and sometimes things look foggy so I needed confirmation. I smelled smoke and saw it but also having my wife there to confirm would have made a huge difference if we were gonna move our daughter out of the room (and give up the precious sleep we expected). 

She tells me to stop yelling at her and that it wasn‚Äôt her fault for not hearing me. Now I‚Äôm incredibly agitated and yell at her ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about what your talking about like at all. Please just go check to see if there‚Äôs smoke‚Äù again, full disclosure, I yelled this at her. 
There‚Äôs smoke near my daughters room And I‚Äôm asking for help. 

She looks at me and says well what do you want me to do about it. Puts her earphones back in and continues her homework. 

I‚Äôm pretty shocked at the lack of care. It turned out to be nothing - smoke from a neighbor burning the dinner but her room was filled with obvious haze that anyone could see. I took her out and let her sleep in our bed. Wife meantime hasn‚Äôt gotten up once from her spot. 

I considered if the smoke was from her( maybe she burned something) but there was no smell or smoke in the kitchen just all in or daughters room. 

I am furious w her right now and seriously contemplating leaving her. 
She‚Äôs always had a lack of accountability but in a potential emergency situation, for her to act like that?! 


AITA here? 

TLDR; wife showed zero concern about smoke near 2 yr olds room and didn‚Äôt go to check even once, out of pure stubbornness and reckless endangered our daughter",1
"AITA for telling my landlord she can‚Äôt name my cat? | 
I was in the process of adopting a cat from the humane society in my town but due to the current situation, all adoptions are postponed until further notice. Whatever, I was fine with that, the cat I was looking at was a cute 10 year old indoor cat and she‚Äôll be taken care of until they reopen. The name the cat had and the name I really wanted to name my next pet were the same, Alaska! 

Fast forward to last weekend, my landlords mom passed away and she left behind a 3 year old cat named Bella. My landlord asked me if I could take her in replace of Alaska, which I was fine with. Here‚Äôs the issue: she wants to rename the cat after her mom, Tammy.

I politely told her I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to change the cats name since it‚Äôs not a kitten anymore and I was fine with what her name was. She‚Äôs literally been pestering me about it since the cat has gotten here. Asking how Tammy is or is Tammy settling in her new home, etc. 

I set up her appointment at the vet for a check up and to change the information on her microchip to say my address. My landlord now wants ‚Äúvet papers‚Äù to verify the pet is healthy and that her new name is there. I already told my landlord I‚Äôm not changing her name and if she wants the cat, she‚Äôs welcome to have her but if she‚Äôs my pet her name stays. My landlord threw a bit of a fit and isn‚Äôt currently speaking to me. 

I told my friend about it and she said I should cut her some slack cause her mom passed away and this is how she‚Äôs grieving. Now I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm the AITA. I‚Äôm trying to be sympathetic to my landlord cause I get the death of a parent is hard but I think she‚Äôs crossing a line. 

(To explain my living situation, my landlord and I are somewhat close. I live in her detached garage that was converted into an apartment, so we see each other all the time. She‚Äôs usually really laid back. Also, she can‚Äôt live with the cat because she‚Äôs allergic.)",0

"AITA Math Teacher yelled at me for being rude and disrespectful | So story time. I got into math class today (10th grade) and was handed a worksheet by my teacher concerning probability. I made a joke (probably not well received) and basically said, ugh why do we have to do probability. My teacher did not seem at all provoked by this comment so I thought he took it as a joke. I finished the worksheet pretty fast (it was simple work) and I raised my hand (nothing else). He came by my desk and I said I was done. Once again he seemed unphased, and he walked off after saying ok. Almost immediately he turned around and said he will check my answers. He looked at my worksheet and at almost all the problems he simply said ""no"" to. He put my worksheet back on my desk and walked off, seeming somewhat irritated. I looked over all my answers and they all seemed correct. So I raised my hand again to ask him. He came by and I asked him about a specific problem. This one I actually did mess up because I didn't understand it. I thanked him for the help, and then asked him about the other problems he said no to. They were all right. He then sort of screamed at me saying ""I just looked over your answers as fast as you did them."" He then called me rude for acting bored and lazy in his class and for making fun of the work. He walked away, and I was kind of stunned. I didn't think i did anything wrong. He came by my desk at the end of class and told me we need to respect each other. I apologized, as I saw how my joke could have been negativly interpreted. He wouldn't listen to me. I didn't do anything with malicious intent but it could be my fault still. I'm sort of a people pleaser too, so I'm really concerned I hurt his feelings or was just rude.  Am I the asshole?

"WIBTA for telling my Mum that I will no longer be complying with her ridiculous cleaning rules? | My (23F) Mum (50F) had an operation last week - as such, she is unable to do much until she has recovered, which is likely to be within 2 weeks. 

I live at home with my parents and 18 year old brother. I work part-time in retail, while also being a full-time uni student in my second year. My brother is also a full-time student in his first year, however he does not have a job. Due to the way my timetable is scheduled, I am currently in my 5th week of a 6 week intensive course - so I have a LOT of homework I should be doing, on top of also working throughout the week. My brother is only in his 3rd week out of a 12 week block, so he has less of a immediate need to be studying everyday. 

Since her operation, my Mum has left all her responsibilities to me. She expects me to mop and vacuum the downstairs portion of our house twice a day (this takes me at least half an hour each time), she also expects me to do the whole family‚Äôs washing everyday (sometimes, this is 6 loads a day), she wants me to make her lunch and the whole family dinner, go do the grocery shopping, clean the bathrooms, vacuum our staircase and rooms upstairs, pack and unpack the dishwasher etc. All this would be fine if I was currently on uni holidays, as I‚Äôd have the time to manage it, however, I am feeling extremely overwhelmed and stressed as I have two major assignments due next week that I have not been able to start because I have been slaving away every single day. 

Last night, I finally hit breaking point. After doing EVERYTHING she asked yesterday, she complained that I hadn‚Äôt washed her favourite pyjamas and she wanted to wear them immediately. She was very passive-aggressive with me and brought up the fact I hadn‚Äôt yet washed her pyjamas 5 times in an hour. I snapped and said that it was unfair I was expected to do all this work, while my brother gets to go out having lunch with friends and hanging out at uni all day. 

This morning, I haven‚Äôt spoken to her or checked on her and I don‚Äôt plan on speaking to her at all today. WIBTA if I simply stopped doing all the jobs she expects me to do?",0

"AITA for making my boyfriend go to the store for me at 1:30am? | Long time reader, first time posting. I'm literally sick to my stomach right now and mad as hell. But I need to know, AITA? 

Little background: boyfriend and I have been living together for 2 years and been dating for 3.5 years. In general I have a sensitive stomach and easily throw up.

My (30f) boyfriend (28m) and I went out tonight, ate a bunch of shit food, had drinks and came back home by 11:30 pm. At midnight I'm calling it a night and he says he isn't feeling well and might stay up. I suggest he drink Pepto, he does, and we both go to bed. I even commented ""wow we both ate the same thing, I wonder what made your stomach upset and not mine?"" 

Boyfriend passes out and by 12:30 I'm in the bathroom violently throwing up and to add insult to injury... Got the poops. I'm trying to be quiet, don't want to wake him up, and eventually get back in bed. But I can't sleep. I clearly have food poisoning, and boyfriend finished the Pepto. I try sleeping. I try ignoring my stomach pain. By 1 am I'm back in the bathroom throwing up again. This isn't me just getting queasy, this is now ""I need to make this stop"" territory. 

After vomiting for the 4th time tonight, I finally decide to wake up my boyfriend. I gently nudge his arm, and say ""I have food poisoning, or something, because I keep throwing up."" He is sleepy as hell, and asks if there is anything he can do to help. I tell him, ""yes actually I need Pepto since he finished the bottle"". And he loses his shit. He doesn't want to get up, and when he does he is throwing his clothes around and making a big scene. I asked why is he so mad. And he says ""because you're always sick!"". To which I replied ""I've never once woken you up and asked you to go to the store."" Which is true. I do get upset stomaches easily. I've literally never even woken him up to simply say ""I don't feel well"". I've handled every upset stomach and painful period on my own. 

Before he leaves he tells me ""I don't feel well too."" When he gets back he tosses the bottle of Pepto to me, grabs his pillow and sleeps on the couch. Says nothing to me. Goes right to sleep.

I still feel like shit. I'm really mad because I didn't choose to get food poisoning. And it's now 2 am. 

Was it an asshole move to make him go to the store when he was tired and apparently also not feeling well? AITA here? I don't think I am, but his attitude makes me think I was supposed to go myself.

UPDATE: Thank you for all the replies! It was mostly nah/esh which helped me realize I'm probably just as cranky as he is. At 4 am I checked on him to make sure he wasn't feeling worse, he immediately asked if I was feeling better and said ""sorry for being a little bitch. I love you and I'm sorry you're not feeling well. That was mean of me earlier"". We hugged and I thanked him for his apology and going to the store, then tucked him back into bed. We good. 

Also thanks for the suggestions of what could be causing my stomach problems, I'm going to do some research and set up more appointments.",0
"UPDATE: AITA for forcing myself to bond with my boyfriend/fiance's daugher? | [Original post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c60m3b/aita_for_forcing_myself_to_bond_with_my/).

I read over the replies to the post and thought really hard about it, although I admit I was often argumentative and didn't really want to listen for the most part. 

Meanwhile, my fiance's daughter came home shortly after I wrote the post. I asked her what she thought of her dad and I getting married, and she said she couldn't wait to spend more time with me and all. 

I opened up and became super honest about my anxieties going into the marriage--how I didn't know how my role would change in her/our family and how I was scared I wasn't ready to be a mom to her and her brother.

She reassured me that my role wouldn't change much and that ""I was already the closest thing to a mom she ever had."" I kinda started crying when she said that, and then she started crying too.

Since her birthday is coming up soon (I always get her a card and write her something meaningful), I've also started to reflect upon all the memories we've shared: all the heavy personal stuff she's talked about with me, her soccer games and her teams' wins and losses, her dance shows, her late night phone calls from college (both happy and sad), etc. 

Now that I'm more clear on what she wants/expects from me after her dad and I get married, I think I've come to realize that yes, at first, I did sort of have to ""force myself"" to bond with her, especially when our relationship was on the rocks. 

But I've really come to love and appreciate my boyfriend's daughter, even through all the arguments and her initial teenage behaviors. Without her, I wouldn't get nearly as many hugs or as much love, and more importantly, I'd have missed out on getting really close with someone as intelligent, talented, and passionate as she is. 

When she was away for the past month or so at school/traveling for the summer, I actually *really* missed her and know that my life wouldn't be the same without her. I missed her hugs, love and her snarky commentary on our favorite shows. I love all the hugs/appreciation I've gotten from her, but she's enriched my life in so many ways. 

So no, Reddit, my boyfriend and I are not getting divorced or breaking off the engagement anytime soon. But thank you for making me really reflect on my thoughts/potential behaviors towards her. I know see how suddenly withholding love could really be harmful towards someone who's gotten close to me (and someone I've grown really close to also). 

I think my fiance's daughter and I will just continue as we are and hopefully grow even closer throughout the years :)",1

"AITA for not making my daughter share her lottery winnings with her stepsister? | 



Even though she‚Äôs under 18 for holidays I always get my daughter a couple of scratchers that I will cash for her. My dad used to do the same for me and it was fun even if I didn‚Äôt win. The only rules I made about them are anything over a hundred dollars goes into a savings account for when she‚Äôs older.

I decided to give my stepdaughter some lottery tickets too. I had asked my wife about it beforehand and she was going to have the same rules with the money except she would be the one to hold onto anything over a hundred for her daughter since we keep our finances mostly separate.

My stepdaughter scratched hers and won $10. My daughter scratched hers and won $300. So I cashed them in and gave my daughter $100 and my stepdaughter the $10. 

My stepdaughter was disappointed and my wife thinks I should have split up the money evenly so each of the girls got at least $55 to spend and $100 to save since the ticket and money were technically mine legally.

I don‚Äôt think splitting up my daughters money would have been fair to her. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt have made my stepdaughter to give mine any of her winnings if she won more.

Edit. Messed up on math. After taking out the $200 and splitting it up they  would get $55 spend.

Edit 2. A lot of people seem to have missed the part where I explained the rule I had about them, so I‚Äôll repeat it. I am not keeping any of the money for myself. The $200 I didn‚Äôt give my daughter went into her savings account that she can use when she‚Äôs older.

Edit 3. They‚Äôre $1 scratchers. The grand prize is under $1000. So no need to worry about one of them winning thousands or millions.

Edit 4. The scratchers were a small side present. They both got lots of other presents too more suited to their interests.",0

"AITA for not wanting to get flu and whooping shots to see my friends newborn baby? | My friend (34F) is having her first baby this week. She's always been a little bit OCD about germs and cleanliness, but she just told me if I want to hold the baby I will have to get these two shots. Initially, I agreed to this because she is my best friend and we are good friends. I know she will need help because she's having a c-section, etc. BUT...I have only ever had one flu shot and never whooping cough. I am fully immunized for the other stuff you get as a younger person. She told me she plans on hiding in her house away from people to avoid getting the baby sick. Other people have questioned her about this and she seems to know it is extreme, but does not care.

&#x200B;

So..there is a part of me that understands this, obviously, newborns are extremely susceptible to sickness and I would never expose her to anything. I did not require all my friends and family to get immunized to see my daughter. I did ask that they wash their hands and don't visit if you're sick or have been sick.

&#x200B;

I guess my question is am I the asshole for not wanting to get these shots and how should I tell my friend? Is there anything I can say to her to make her feel better?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I won't and did not plan on lying to her. If I don't get the shots, I will not go see the baby. I may be an asshole, but I'm not a monster.

To those of you asking why I don't want to get the flu shot - I have a 3 yo, she always gets the flu shot and I got one when she was under 1 yo. Prior to that I've never had a flu shot and I've never had the flu (knock on all the wood) BUT I understand that people get them. I just never felt pressured to by my doctor or anything and I have a pretty ok immune system. I also know THAT WILL NOT PREVENT ME FROM GETTING THE FLU - okay so I hear you all.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: I did receive a whooping cough shot as a child and while I was pregnant with my child.

They broke up, and she came running back and I blew her off. I felt so shitty about it because I heard much later on she had depression not long after and struggled making friends.


We met up recently and I apologized, she accepted. Not gonna lie, I was open to whatever happened. Whether she wants to be friends or date, I wasn't going to bail on friendship.


She made it clear she had a BF which sucks but I'm OK with. Eventually we started texting daily and hanging every week.


Something odd I noticed was she would always complain about having no money. She would suggest we'd go to mid priced places to eat, but then say ""I didn't get paid from work so won't order anything"". 


And I just end up eating by myself. I've bought her food before when she was unemployed but she has a job now. Anyway she recently told me that when she was broke she went on tinder dates with guys to get a free dinner. That same day she brought up to me which places in my city do the best steak.


I told her I don't eat out often unless its a special occasion. She asked again about 5mins later and I changed the subject. We were supposed to hang out most of the day but she cut it off after 2hrs to go home after she dragged me to a restaurant she likes and we didn't get anything. She let me know she only had $25 in her account that has to last 2 days.

I messaged her saying this just friends thing doesn't work for me and I don't want to go out for meals anymore and she just goes ""sure, thanks for letting me know"".

Nintendo switch online has a family plan that will allow you to add up to 8 ppl to family plan.  I purchased the plan and asked a few buddies if they wanted to buy in for $5. For the first year of membership I had 7 slots filled and 1 free. A buddy of mine asked me in August if I still had a slot and I told him sure I'll add him. At the time I told him don't worry about paying me $5 for now since the year was almost up, and that is hit him up renewal time. 

Renewal period came and I posted a note in our group chat that for anyone who was on the plan, and wanted to renew to go ahead and PayPal me the cash. Everyone paid except him. 

Now fast fwd to Christmas and my sister got a switch and Mario kart 8. Would love to have all my nieces and nephews online playing with me and my son but she currently doesn't have online service. 

WIBTA if I just bump him without saying anything and add my sister since he failed to pay up for renewal (after sending 2 reminders to the group)?",0

"AITA for suggesting moving to another state? | I'm an accountant and my wife is a housewife. We have been married for 3 years. She has a kid from a previous marriage, he is 11 years old, and I have a good relationship with him. My wife's ex-husband remarried too and now they have a little  daughter with his wife. (I don't know how old is the girl, but I think around 3-4)

My step-son sees his dad at least once a week, but also everytime his dad, his dad's wife and his little sister make plans, they include him. And that is awesome, don't get me wrong.

Everytime my wife and I need a babysitter, she always call her ex-husband first, to see if he can take care of my step-son and only if he is not available she calls a babysitter. I never felt comfortable with this  because I felt as if everytime I make plans with my wife, we always informed her ex-husband. I would have felt more comfortable if we hired a babysitter first and only had the ex-husband as a back up plan.

Recently, I found out about a better job opportunity, but it's in the other side of the country. I would be making almost twice as much as I'm making now and I would be in a better position. It's not a sure thing yet, but the posibility is there. When I told my wife about it I thought she was going to be happy, but instead she said it was not possible.

She said she didn't want to move to another state because she didn't want to take my step-son away from his dad. That kind of pissed me off, because I'm her husband and it kind of felt as if she was putting her ex-husband's needs above our family well-being.

I told her that, and she got mad and said it was not about her husband, it was about my step-son who adored his dad and little sister and it would be hard for him to be away from them. I understand that, but kids adapt pretty quickly and it's not as if we live in 1950, he can still call them and text them and see them on vacations.

Then she told me that if we move to another city, she won't be able to leave my step-son with his dad when she needs someone to look after him, or call our regular babysitter. I told her how I never felt comfortable leaving my step-son with his dad when we want to make plans because that feels as if I have to let her ex-husband know everytime we make plans and that the kid is 11 now anyway and he is too old for a babysitter, since the city we are planning to move to is a fairly safe city.

So now she is mad at me.

"WIBTA if I refused to name our child after my father-in-law | Not sure if it is obligatory for me to state this is a throwaway..

Anyway, my husband and I are planning to try for a baby soon, so the topic of baby names came up. In my husband's culture, it is tradition to name the firstborn son after the child's grandfather. This wouldn't be an issue for me at all, except that his father and my ex-boyfriend have the exact same name.

This ex and I dated for two years, and I was convinced that we would end up together. I was completely head over heels for this guy. After two years, I found out he had been using me the whole time, and the breakup was really, really devastating for me to the point where I had to see a therapist to help me work through it. It took me almost two years to get over him and the whole situation.

Fast forward to now, I got over my ex and married an amazing guy, but he is insisting that our firstborn son has to have this name which is common to his father and my ex. I understand how important his culture is to him, and that his father would be extremely hurt if we didn't honor him by naming our kid after him, but here are my issues:

The most obvious is that after spending so much time trying to erase my ex from my mind, I don't want to say/hear that name 294 times a day. I associate that name with so many bad feelings.
My family and friends saw how much I suffered when we broke up. So they know how hard it was for me and they saw how this guy just disposed of me like trash. It would be really humiliating to tell my parents, family, and friends that we've chosen this name. Even if we explain the tradition behind it, I still feel like everyone is going to tell me I'm an idiot and give me a hard time about it.
This ex is in the same small community circle as my husband, so he would definitely know what we name our child. I just don't want to give him the satisfaction of being able to one-up me one last time.

I've tried to casually suggest to my husband that we go a different route with the name. He knows how much I suffered at the hands of this ex, and sympathizes with me, but he said the name is non-negotiable. As I said, I understand how important the name is to him, but I just feel like this whole situation is ridiculous and I hate the idea of my child sharing a name with my ex who caused me so much pain. So would I be the asshole if I just put my foot down and said that I am not giving this name to our future son?

EDIT:
I should emphasize that besides tradition, he wants to follow this naming convention out of a lot of love and respect for his father.

Also, my FIL's middle name is my husband's first name. The two names basically just switch with every generation. It's a very specific naming tradition, so using FIL's middle name would be going against the tradition.",0

"AITA for wanting to eat dinner half an hour before a restaurant closes? | My girlfriend works in a retail setting.  I have not for many years.  Neither of us has ever worked in a sit-down restaurant.  Last night I really wanted to go out to dinner rather than cook, but it was fairly late and we wouldn't have made it to the casual dining restaurant until half an hour *before* their closing time.  My girlfriend insisted that by the time we finished it would be at least forty five minutes after closing and that we were being rude to the restaurant staff who just want to go home on time.  My position was that we'd hardly be the only ones the staff was waiting on and that they have no real expectation of going home at closing time anyway - most restaurant staff are going to be on shift for an hour or two after the customers leave cleaning up and tearing down.  We had a mild fight about it and ended up ordering pizza.

So Am I the Asshole?  I always tip 20%+ (U.S.) and try to tip in cash when possible as I'm aware of the prevailing wage laws for wait staff.  I wouldn't think they'd object to seating another paying guest close to closing time, even if the guest may still be eating after close.  I admittedly have never worked as a waiter however, am I being rude and keeping someone past their shift?",1
"AITA for getting frustrated with my girlfriends migraines? | My girlfriend of 2 years (28 yrs old) gets a severe migraine at least once a week.

I love her dearly and I hate to see her in pain. I try to do everything I can to help. (Rub her head, get her ice/heat pack, turn off lights and noises) 

She often leaves work because of them and is down for the count the rest of the night. She expects me to lay with her all night from the time I get off of work until we go to bed every time she gets one. Or on the weekends sometimes a whole day. It‚Äôs frustrating because I have to skip the gym, grocery store, errands, and anything else I have going on to lay with her. She gets offended if I say I‚Äôm going to do anything else. 

I feel selfish and I know it‚Äôs not her fault she gets them and I don‚Äôt understand what she‚Äôs going through. But I don‚Äôt know how to tell her that sometimes even if she has a migraine I still have things to do. 

AITA?

Edit: She has been to 4 neuro clinics, tried many different daily medications as well as onset medications, Shots, Botox, vitamin IVs, getting her eyes checked, medicinal marijuana, special diet, you name it.   In the past 13 years she‚Äôs tried it all. Her doctors are stumped.

Edit: If she‚Äôs feeling better tomorrow I‚Äôm going to have a conversation with her about my feelings. I don‚Äôt want to resent her. Thank you all for the advice. ‚ù§Ô∏è",0
