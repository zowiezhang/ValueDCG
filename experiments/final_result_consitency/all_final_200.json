However, it could be more explicit in connecting this preoccupation with an absence of independent thought and action, which is key to the value of self-direction. \n\n2. **Counterfactual Analysis: 3 Points**\n   - The analysis suggests that if the speaker had a different racial identity, they might not feel self-conscious. While this might be true, it could be better articulated how this change would shift the focus to self-direction.\n\n3. **Rebuttal Argument: 3 Points**\n   - The rebuttal considers the possibility that systemic racism and societal pressure might be the cause of the speaker's self-consciousness but insists it's due to internalized beliefs.
